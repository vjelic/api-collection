This vulnerability is classified as a Remote Code Execution (RCE) vulnerability. It arises from the library's ability to deserialize arbitrary XML data, which can be exploited by an attacker to execute arbitrary code on the host system. This is particularly dangerous in scenarios where the application processes XML data from untrusted sources.\n\n### General Mitigation Advice\n\n1. **Upgrade**: The most effective mitigation is to upgrade to a version of `xstream` that has addressed this vulnerability. Versions 1.4.18 and later have patches that mitigate this issue.\n\n2. **Input Validation**: Ensure that any XML data being deserialized is from a trusted source. Implement strict input validation and sanitization to prevent malicious data from being processed.\n\n3. **Security Frameworks**: Use security frameworks or libraries that provide additional layers of protection against deserialization vulnerabilities.\n\n4. **Deserialization Controls**: Configure `xstream` to limit the types of objects that can be deserialized. This can be done by setting up a whitelist of allowed classes.\n\n### Source Code Fix Recommendation\n\nTo mitigate this vulnerability in the source code, you can configure `xstream` to use a whitelist approach for deserialization. Here is an example of how you can do this:\n\n```java\nimport com.thoughtworks.xstream.XStream;\nimport com.thoughtworks.xstream.security.NoTypePermission;\nimport com.thoughtworks.xstream.security.WildcardTypePermission;\n\nXStream xstream = new XStream();\n\n// Clear out existing permissions and set up a whitelist\nxstream.addPermission(NoTypePermission.NONE);\nxstream.addPermission(new WildcardTypePermission(new String[] {\n    \"com.yourcompany.yourapp.**\"\n}));\n\n// Now you can safely deserialize objects\nObject obj = xstream.fromXML(xmlData);\n```\n\n### Relevant OWASP Resources\n\n- [OWASP Deserialization Cheat Sheet](https://cheatsheetseries.owasp.org/cheatsheets/Deserialization_Cheat_Sheet.html)\n- [OWASP Top Ten 2021: A08:2021 - Software and Data Integrity Failures](https://owasp.org/Top10/A08_2021-Software_and_Data_Integrity_Failures/)\n\n### Common Weakness Enumeration (CWE)\n\n- [CWE-502: Deserialization of Untrusted Data](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/502.html)"

This vulnerability arises from improper handling of HTTP request headers, which can lead to a Denial of Service (DoS) attack. An attacker can exploit this vulnerability by sending specially crafted HTTP requests that consume excessive server resources, potentially leading to service disruption.\n\n### Mitigation Advice\n\n1. **Upgrade**: The primary mitigation strategy is to upgrade to a patched version of Jetty Server. Check the official Jetty release notes or repository for the latest version that addresses this vulnerability.\n\n2. **Rate Limiting**: Implement rate limiting on incoming requests to prevent abuse by malicious actors.\n\n3. **Input Validation**: Ensure that all incoming HTTP headers are validated and sanitized to prevent malformed requests from being processed.\n\n4. **Monitoring and Alerts**: Set up monitoring and alerting for unusual traffic patterns that may indicate an ongoing attack.\n\n### Source Code Fix Recommendation\n\nTo address this vulnerability, consider the following code changes:\n\n- **Update Jetty Server**: Ensure your `pom.xml` or build configuration is updated to use a secure version of Jetty Server. For example:\n\n  ```xml\n  <dependency>\n      <groupId>org.eclipse.jetty</groupId>\n      <artifactId>jetty-server</artifactId>\n      <version>11.0.19</version> <!-- Use the latest patched version -->\n  </dependency>\n  ```\n\n- **Implement Request Filters**: Add request filters to validate and limit the size of incoming headers.\n\n  ```java\n  public class HeaderValidationFilter implements Filter {\n      @Override\n      public void doFilter(ServletRequest request, ServletResponse response, FilterChain chain)\n              throws IOException, ServletException {\n          HttpServletRequest httpRequest = (HttpServletRequest) request;\n          Enumeration<String> headerNames = httpRequest.getHeaderNames();\n          while (headerNames.hasMoreElements()) {\n              String headerName = headerNames.nextElement();\n              String headerValue = httpRequest.getHeader(headerName);\n              if (headerValue.length() > MAX_HEADER_SIZE) {\n                  throw new ServletException(\"Header size exceeds limit\");\n              }\n          }\n          chain.doFilter(request, response);\n      }\n  }\n  ```\n\n### OWASP Resources\n\n- [OWASP Top Ten](https://owasp.org/www-project-top-ten/)\n- [OWASP Cheat Sheet Series](https://cheatsheetseries.owasp.org/)\n\n### Common Weakness Enumeration (CWE)\n\n- [CWE-400: Uncontrolled Resource Consumption ('Resource Exhaustion')](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/400.html)\n```"

                "markdown": "\nCommand injection is an attack in which the goal is execution of arbitrary commands on the host operating system via a vulnerable application. Command injection attacks are possible when an application passes unsafe user supplied data (forms, cookies, HTTP headers etc.) to a system shell. In this attack, the attacker-supplied operating system commands are usually executed with the privileges of the vulnerable application. Command injection attacks are possible largely due to insufficient input validation.\n\nAssume all input is malicious. Use an \"accept known good\" input validation strategy, i.e., use a list of acceptable inputs that strictly conform to specifications. Reject any input that does not strictly conform to specifications, or transform it into something that does.\n\nWhen performing input validation, consider all potentially relevant properties, including length, type of input, the full range of acceptable values, missing or extra inputs, syntax, consistency across related fields, and conformance to business rules. As an example of business rule logic, \"boat\" may be syntactically valid because it only contains alphanumeric characters, but it is not valid if the input is only expected to contain colors such as \"red\" or \"blue.\"\n\nDo not rely exclusively on looking for malicious or malformed inputs. This is likely to miss at least one undesirable input, especially if the code's environment changes. This can give attackers enough room to bypass the intended validation. However, denylists can be useful for detecting potential attacks or determining which inputs are so malformed that they should be rejected outright.\n\n## Solution (Input Validation)\n\n```java\n\n    // Predefined whitelist of allowed commands\n    private static final Set<String> ALLOWED_COMMANDS = new HashSet<>();\n\n    public boolean validateCommand(String command) {\n        // Check if the command is in the whitelist\n        return ALLOWED_COMMANDS.contains(command);\n    }\n```\n\n\n## In Context Remediation\n```\nParameter name: p\nAllowed commands: Windows: type, more, find; Linux: cat, more, grep\n```\n```\nParameter name: Runtime.getRuntime().exec(taskAction)\nAllowed commands: Windows: cmd.exe, powershell.exe; Linux: bash, sh, zsh, ksh, csh, tcsh, dash\n```\nHere is a simple example of how you can implement a whitelist of allowed OS commands in Java. This example uses a console application.\n\n```java\nimport java.io.IOException;\nimport java.io.ObjectInputStream;\nimport java.util.Arrays;\nimport java.util.List;\n\npublic class VulnerableTaskHolder {\n    private String taskAction;\n\n    private void readObject(ObjectInputStream stream) throws Exception {\n        taskAction = (String) stream.readObject();\n        validateCommand(taskAction);\n        Runtime.getRuntime().exec(taskAction);\n    }\n\n    private void validateCommand(String command) throws Exception {\n        List<String> allowedCommands;\n        String os = System.getProperty(\"os.name\").toLowerCase();\n\n        if (os.contains(\"win\")) {\n            allowedCommands = Arrays.asList(\"cmd.exe\", \"powershell.exe\");\n        } else if (os.contains(\"nix\") || os.contains(\"nux\") || os.contains(\"mac\")) {\n            allowedCommands = Arrays.asList(\"bash\", \"sh\", \"zsh\", \"ksh\", \"csh\", \"tcsh\", \"dash\");\n        } else {\n            throw new Exception(\"Unsupported operating system\");\n        }\n\n        if (!allowedCommands.contains(command)) {\n            throw new Exception(\"Command not allowed\");\n        }\n    }\n\n    public static void main(String[] args) throws Exception {\n        VulnerableTaskHolder holder = new VulnerableTaskHolder();\n        holder.validateCommand(\"bash\");\n    }\n}\n```\n\nThis application doesn't require any additional dependencies to run. It uses only standard Java libraries. \n\nPlease note that this is a very basic example and might not cover all possible security issues. For example, it doesn't check if the command is followed by any potentially harmful parameters. It's also worth mentioning that using Runtime.exec() can be dangerous and should be avoided if possible. \n\nAlso, this example assumes that the command is a single string without any parameters. If the command can contain parameters, you would need to split the command by spaces and validate each part separately.\n\n\n\n## References\n- [OWASP: Command Injection](https://owasp.org/www-community/attacks/Command_Injection)\n- [OWASP: Input Validation Cheat Sheet](https://cheatsheetseries.owasp.org/cheatsheets/Input_Validation_Cheat_Sheet.html)\n- [CWE-77: Command Injection](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/77.html)\n\n\n"

This vulnerability is also known as \"Unvalidated Redirects and Forwards\" and can lead to phishing attacks, session theft, and forceful browsing.\n\nIn the provided code snippet, the application is redirecting to a URL that is constructed by appending user-controlled input (`course.getFirstLesson().getLink()`) to a static base. If an attacker can manipulate this input, they could potentially redirect users to malicious websites or expose internal resources.\n\n## Mitigation Advice\n\nTo mitigate this vulnerability, it is recommended to avoid using user-controlled input to construct redirect URLs. If this is not possible, ensure that the input is properly validated and sanitized before use. \n\n## Source Code Fix Recommendation\n\nHere is a simple fix for the provided code snippet:\n\n```java\nString link = course.getFirstLesson().getLink();\nif (isValid(link)) {\n    return new ModelAndView(\"redirect:\" + \"start.mvc\" + link);\n} else {\n    // handle invalid link\n}\n```\n\nIn this code, `isValid(link)` is a method that checks if the link is valid.

If the CSRF protection is disabled in a Spring application, it can lead to potential CSRF attacks.\n\n## General Mitigation Advice\n\n1. **Enable CSRF Protection**: Always enable CSRF protection in your Spring application. Spring Security provides built-in CSRF protection that can be enabled in your application.\n\n2. **Use Anti-CSRF Tokens**: Use anti-CSRF tokens in your application. These tokens are included in requests and validated by the server. They provide a way to ensure that the requester knowingly and willingly made the request.\n\n3. **Update and Patch**: Always keep your Spring framework and all other dependencies up-to-date. Newer versions often come with security patches that fix known vulnerabilities.\n\n## Source Code Fix Recommendation\n\nIn Spring, CSRF protection is enabled by default. If it has been disabled, it can be re-enabled by removing the `.csrf().disable()` line from your Spring Security configuration.\n\nHere is an example of a Spring Security configuration with CSRF protection enabled:\n\n```java\n@Configuration\n@EnableWebSecurity\npublic class WebSecurityConfig extends WebSecurityConfigurerAdapter {\n    @Override\n    protected void configure(HttpSecurity http) throws Exception {\n        http\n            .csrf().and() // This line enables CSRF protection\n            .authorizeRequests()\n                .antMatchers(\"/resources/**\", \"/signup\", \"/about\").permitAll()\n                .anyRequest().authenticated()\n                .and()\n            .formLogin()\n                .loginPage(\"/login\")\n                .permitAll()\n                .and()\n            .logout()\n                .permitAll();\n    }\n}\n```\n\n## OWASP Resources\n\n- [Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) Prevention Cheat Sheet](https://cheatsheetseries.owasp.org/cheatsheets/Cross-Site_Request_Forgery_Prevention_Cheat_Sheet.html)\n- [CSRF Prevention in Java](https://cheatsheetseries.owasp.org/cheatsheets/Cross-Site_Request_Forgery_Prevention_Cheat_Sheet.html#java)\n\n## Common Weakness Enumeration (CWE)\n\n- [CWE-352: Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/352.html)"

This vulnerability arises from the library's deserialization process, which can be exploited to execute arbitrary code. The issue is due to insufficient validation of the input data during the deserialization process, allowing attackers to manipulate the input stream and execute malicious code on the host system.\n\n### General Mitigation Advice\n\n1. **Upgrade**: The most effective mitigation is to upgrade to a version of `xstream` that has addressed this vulnerability. Versions `1.4.16` and later have patches that fix this issue.\n\n2. **Input Validation**: Implement strict input validation to ensure that only trusted data is deserialized. This can be done by configuring XStream to use a whitelist of allowed classes.\n\n3. **Security Frameworks**: Use security frameworks or libraries that provide additional layers of protection against deserialization attacks.\n\n4. **Network Segmentation**: Limit the exposure of vulnerable services by segmenting networks and restricting access to trusted sources only.\n\n### Source Code Fix Recommendation\n\nTo mitigate this vulnerability in the source code, you can configure XStream to use a whitelist approach. Here is an example of how to do this:\n\n```java\nimport com.thoughtworks.xstream.XStream;\nimport com.thoughtworks.xstream.security.NoTypePermission;\n\n// Create a new XStream instance\nXStream xstream = new XStream();\n\n// Clear out existing permissions and set up a whitelist\nxstream.addPermission(NoTypePermission.NONE);\nxstream.allowTypesByWildcard(new String[] {\n    \"com.yourcompany.yourapp.**\"\n});\n\n// Deserialize only trusted data\nObject obj = xstream.fromXML(xmlInput);\n```\n\n### OWASP Resources\n\n- [OWASP Deserialization Cheat Sheet](https://cheatsheetseries.owasp.org/cheatsheets/Deserialization_Cheat_Sheet.html)\n- [OWASP Top Ten 2021: A08:2021 - Software and Data Integrity Failures](https://owasp.org/Top10/A08_2021-Software_and_Data_Integrity_Failures/)\n\n### Common Weakness Enumeration (CWE)\n\n- [CWE-502: Deserialization of Untrusted Data](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/502.html)"

                "markdown": "\nA path traversal attack (also known as directory traversal) aims to access files and directories that are stored outside the web root folder. By manipulating variables that reference files with “dot-dot-slash (../)” sequences and its variations or by using absolute file paths, it may be possible to access arbitrary files and directories stored on file system including application source code or configuration and critical system files.\n\nTo mitigate this vulnerability in Java, you can use path canonicalization and ensure that the resolved path is within a designated base directory. \n\n## Solution (Path Canonicalization)\n\n```java\n\n    // Base directory where files are allowed to be accessed\n    private static final String BASE_DIRECTORY = \"/safe/base/directory\";\n\n        /**\n         * Resolves the user input to a secure file path within the base directory.\n         *\n         * @param userInput The user-provided file path.\n         * @return A File object if the path is valid and within the base directory, otherwise null.\n         * @throws IOException If an error occurs during path resolution.\n         */\n        public static File getSecureFile(String userInput) throws IOException {\n            // Create a file object from the user input\n            File file = new File(BASE_DIRECTORY, userInput);\n\n            // Canonicalize the file path\n            String canonicalPath = file.getCanonicalPath();\n\n            // Check if the canonical path starts with the base directory path\n            if (canonicalPath.startsWith(new File(BASE_DIRECTORY).getCanonicalPath())) {\n                return file;\n            } else {\n                // The path is outside the base directory, deny access\n                return null;\n            }\n        }\n\n```\n\n\n## In Context Remediation\n```\nPath construction: new File(webgoatHome)\nPath canonicalization: new File(webgoatHome).getCanonicalPath()\n```\nHere is a simple Java console application that demonstrates how to canonicalize a file path securely. This application uses Apache Commons IO library to perform the canonicalization.\n\n```java\nimport org.apache.commons.io.FilenameUtils;\nimport java.io.File;\nimport java.io.IOException;\n\npublic class FilePathCanonicalization {\n\n    public static void main(String[] args) {\n        String webgoatHome = \"/path/to/webgoatHome\"; // This should be replaced with the actual path\n        File pluginTargetDirectory = new File(webgoatHome);\n\n        try {\n            String canonicalPath = pluginTargetDirectory.getCanonicalPath();\n            String intendedDirectory = \"/path/to/intendedDirectory\"; // This should be replaced with the actual path\n\n            if (FilenameUtils.directoryContains(intendedDirectory, canonicalPath)) {\n                System.out.println(\"The file resides within the intended directory.\");\n            } else {\n                System.out.println(\"The file does not reside within the intended directory.\");\n            }\n        } catch (IOException e) {\n            e.printStackTrace();\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\n\nThis application uses the `getCanonicalPath()` method of the `File` class to get the canonical path of the file. It then uses the `directoryContains()` method of the `FilenameUtils` class from Apache Commons IO library to check if the file resides within the intended directory.\n\nTo run this application, you need to have the following dependencies:\n\n1. Java Development Kit (JDK) - to compile and run the Java application.\n2. Apache Commons IO - to use the `FilenameUtils` class for file path canonicalization.\n\nYou can add Apache Commons IO to your project using the following Maven dependency:\n\n```xml\n<dependency>\n    <groupId>commons-io</groupId>\n    <artifactId>commons-io</artifactId>\n    <version>2.8.0</version>\n</dependency>\n```\n\nPlease replace \"/path/to/webgoatHome\" and \"/path/to/intendedDirectory\" with the actual paths in your system.\n\n\n\n## References\n- [OWASP: Path Traversal](https://owasp.org/www-community/attacks/Path_Traversal)\n- [OWASP: Input Validation Cheat Sheet](https://cheatsheetseries.owasp.org/cheatsheets/Input_Validation_Cheat_Sheet.html)\n- [CWE-22: Improper Limitation of a Pathname to a Restricted Directory ('Path Traversal')](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/22.html)\n\n\n"

This vulnerability allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code by manipulating the XML input processed by the library. The issue arises from the library's deserialization process, which does not adequately restrict the types of objects that can be deserialized, leading to potential remote code execution (RCE).\n\n### General Mitigation Advice\n\n1. **Upgrade**: The most effective mitigation is to upgrade to a version of `xstream` that has addressed this vulnerability. Versions 1.4.16 and later have implemented security measures to prevent this type of attack.\n\n2. **Input Validation**: Implement strict input validation to ensure that only trusted XML data is processed by the application.\n\n3. **Security Frameworks**: Use security frameworks or libraries that provide additional layers of protection against deserialization vulnerabilities.\n\n4. **Deserialization Whitelisting**: Configure `xstream` to use a whitelist of allowed classes for deserialization. This can be done by setting up a `SecurityMapper` or using the `XStream.setupDefaultSecurity()` method.\n\n### Source Code Fix Recommendation\n\nTo mitigate this vulnerability in the source code, you can configure `xstream` to use a whitelist approach for deserialization.

This vulnerability arises from the library's inadequate handling of untrusted XML input, which can lead to XML External Entity (XXE) attacks. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability to read arbitrary files on the server, perform server-side request forgery (SSRF), or execute other malicious activities by crafting a specially designed XML payload.\n\n### General Mitigation Advice\n1. **Upgrade**: The most effective mitigation is to upgrade to a version of `xstream` where this vulnerability is patched. Check the [official XStream website](https://x-stream.github.io/) or the [Maven repository](https://search.maven.org/) for the latest secure version.\n\n2. **Input Validation**: Implement strict input validation to ensure that only trusted XML data is processed by the application.\n\n3. **Disable External Entities**: Configure the XML parser to disable external entity processing. This can be done by setting the appropriate parser features, such as:\n   ```java\n   SAXParserFactory spf = SAXParserFactory.newInstance();\n   spf.setFeature(\"http://xml.org/sax/features/external-general-entities\", false);\n   spf.setFeature(\"http://xml.org/sax/features/external-parameter-entities\", false);\n   spf.setFeature(\"http://apache.org/xml/features/disallow-doctype-decl\", true);\n   ```\n\n4. **Use a Secure Parser**: Consider using a secure XML parser that is less susceptible to XXE attacks.\n\n### Source Code Fix Recommendation\nTo address this vulnerability in the source code, ensure that the XML parser is configured securely. Here is an example of how to configure the `XStream` instance to prevent XXE:\n\n```java\nXStream xstream = new XStream();\nxstream.addPermission(NoTypePermission.NONE); // Forbid all classes\nxstream.addPermission(NullPermission.NULL);   // Allow null\nxstream.addPermission(PrimitiveTypePermission.PRIMITIVES); // Allow primitive types\nxstream.allowTypesByWildcard(new String[] {\n    \"your.package.**\" // Allow specific packages\n});\n```\n\n### OWASP Resources\n- [OWASP XML External Entity (XXE) Prevention Cheat Sheet](https://cheatsheetseries.owasp.org/cheatsheets/XML_External_Entity_Prevention_Cheat_Sheet.html)\n- [OWASP Top Ten 2021](https://owasp.org/Top10/)\n\n### Common Weakness Enumeration (CWE)\n- [CWE-611: Improper Restriction of XML External Entity Reference ('XXE')](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/611.html)\n```"

Check the [XStream changelog](https://x-stream.github.io/changes.html) for the latest secure version.\n\n2. **Input Validation**: Implement strict input validation to ensure that only trusted XML data is processed. This can be done by setting up a whitelist of allowed classes.\n\n3. **Use Security Frameworks**: Consider using security frameworks or libraries that provide additional protection against deserialization vulnerabilities.\n\n4. **Run with Least Privileges**: Ensure that the application runs with the least privileges necessary, reducing the potential impact of a successful exploit.\n\n### Source Code Fix Recommendation\n\nTo mitigate this vulnerability in the source code, you can configure XStream to allow only specific classes to be deserialized. Here is an example of how to set up a whitelist:\n\n```java\nXStream xstream = new XStream();\nxstream.addPermission(NoTypePermission.NONE); // Forbid all classes by default\nxstream.addPermission(NullPermission.NULL);   // Allow null values\nxstream.addPermission(PrimitiveTypePermission.PRIMITIVES); // Allow primitive types\nxstream.allowTypesByWildcard(new String[] {\n    \"com.yourcompany.yourapp.**\" // Allow your specific classes\n});\n```\n\n### OWASP Resources\n\n- [OWASP Deserialization of Untrusted Data](https://owasp.org/www-community/vulnerabilities/Deserialization_of_untrusted_data)\n- [OWASP Top Ten 2021](https://owasp.org/Top10/)\n\n### Common Weakness Enumeration (CWE)\n\n- [CWE-502: Deserialization of Untrusted Data](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/502.html)"

This vulnerability arises from improper input validation in the context module, which can lead to remote code execution (RCE) if exploited. An attacker could potentially exploit this flaw by sending specially crafted requests to the application, allowing them to execute arbitrary code on the server.\n\n### General Mitigation Advice\n\n1. **Upgrade**: The most effective mitigation is to upgrade to a patched version of the `spring-context` package. Check the official Spring Framework repository or advisories for the latest secure version.\n\n2. **Input Validation**: Implement strict input validation and sanitization to ensure that only expected data is processed by the application.\n\n3. **Security Patches**: Regularly apply security patches and updates to all components of your application stack.\n\n4. **Network Security**: Use firewalls and intrusion detection systems to monitor and block suspicious activities.\n\n5. **Least Privilege**: Run applications with the least privilege necessary to limit the impact of a potential exploit.\n\n### Source Code Fix Recommendation\n\nReview the code handling user inputs and ensure that all inputs are validated and sanitized. Consider using Spring's built-in validation mechanisms or third-party libraries like Hibernate Validator to enforce constraints on data.\n\nExample of input validation using Spring's `@Valid` annotation:\n\n```java\nimport javax.validation.Valid;\nimport org.springframework.web.bind.annotation.*;\n\n@RestController\npublic class ExampleController {\n\n    @PostMapping(\"/process\")\n    public ResponseEntity<String> processInput(@Valid @RequestBody InputData inputData) {\n        // Process the validated input data\n        return ResponseEntity.ok(\"Input processed successfully\");\n    }\n}\n```\n\n### OWASP Resources\n\n- [OWASP Top Ten](https://owasp.org/www-project-top-ten/)\n- [OWASP Cheat Sheet Series](https://cheatsheetseries.owasp.org/)\n\n### Common Weakness Enumeration (CWE)\n\n- [CWE-20: Improper Input Validation](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/20.html)\n```"

This vulnerability is related to the use of insecure deserialization in the Guava library, which can potentially allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code if they can control the input to the deserialization process. This is a common issue in Java applications where serialized data is accepted from untrusted sources.\n\n### General Mitigation Advice\n\n1. **Upgrade Guava**: The most straightforward mitigation is to upgrade to a version of Guava where this vulnerability is fixed. Check the [Guava release notes](https://github.com/google/guava/releases) for the latest secure version.\n\n2. **Avoid Deserialization of Untrusted Data**: Ensure that your application does not deserialize data from untrusted sources. If deserialization is necessary, consider using a library that provides additional security checks.\n\n3. **Use a Security Manager**: Implement a Java Security Manager to restrict the actions that can be performed by deserialized objects.\n\n4. **Input Validation**: Validate and sanitize all inputs before processing them, especially if they are used in deserialization.\n\n### Source Code Fix Recommendation\n\nIf upgrading is not immediately possible, consider the following code-level mitigations:\n\n- **Custom Deserialization Logic**: Implement custom deserialization logic that includes validation and security checks.\n  \n- **Use Alternative Libraries**: Consider using alternative libraries that provide safer serialization mechanisms, such as JSON or XML-based serialization.\n\n### Relevant OWASP Resources\n\n- [OWASP Deserialization Cheat Sheet](https://cheatsheetseries.owasp.org/cheatsheets/Deserialization_Cheat_Sheet.html)\n- [OWASP Top Ten 2021: A08:2021 - Software and Data Integrity Failures](https://owasp.org/Top10/A08_2021-Software_and_Data_Integrity_Failures/)\n\n### Common Weakness Enumeration (CWE)\n\n- [CWE-502: Deserialization of Untrusted Data](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/502.html)"

                "markdown": "\nThe input values included in SQL queries need to be passed in safely. Bind variables in prepared statements can be used to easily mitigate the risk of SQL injection. Alternatively to prepare statements, each parameter can be escaped manually.\n\n**Solution (Prepared Statements):**\n\n```java\nString query = \"SELECT * FROM User WHERE id = ?\";\nPreparedStatement preparedStatement = connection.prepareStatement(query);\npreparedStatement.setString(1, inputId);\nResultSet resultSet = preparedStatement.executeQuery();\n```\n\n**Solution (Encoding):**\n\n```java\nimport org.owasp.esapi.Encoder;\ncreateQuery(\"select * from User where id = '\" + Encoder.encodeForSQL(inputId) + \"'\");\n```\n\n\n## In Context Remediation\n```java\nVulnerable Query: \"SET SCHEMA \\\"\" %2B (WebGoatUser) $obj0.getUsername() %2B \"\\\"\"\n\nRemediated Query: To fix SQL injection vulnerabilities in Java code, you should use `PreparedStatement` instead of concatenating SQL queries with user inputs. Here's how you can transform the given input into a safe version using `PreparedStatement`:\n\n### Input:\n```java\n\"SET SCHEMA \\\"\" + (WebGoatUser) $obj0.getUsername() + \"\\\"\"\n```\n\n### Output:\n```java\nString query = \"SET SCHEMA ?\";\nPreparedStatement statement = connection.prepareStatement(query);\nstatement.setString(1, ((WebGoatUser) $obj0).getUsername());\nstatement.executeUpdate();\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n1. **Parameterized Query**: Replace the direct concatenation of user input into the SQL query with a parameterized query using `?` placeholders.\n2. **PreparedStatement**: Use `PreparedStatement` to prepare the SQL query. This helps in preventing SQL injection by treating the input as data rather than executable code.\n3. **Set Parameters**: Use `setString` (or other appropriate `set` methods) to bind the user input to the query parameters. This ensures that the input is properly escaped and treated as a literal value.\n\nBy following these steps, you can effectively mitigate SQL injection vulnerabilities in your Java applications.\n```\nTo prevent SQL Injection using Prepared Statements, you can modify the vulnerable SQL query to use a `PreparedStatement` object. Below is a Java console application example demonstrating this approach:\n\n```java\nimport java.sql.Connection;\nimport java.sql.DriverManager;\nimport java.sql.PreparedStatement;\nimport java.sql.SQLException;\n\npublic class SQLInjectionPreventionExample {\n    public static void main(String[] args) {\n        String jdbcUrl = \"jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/yourdatabase\";\n        String dbUser = \"yourusername\";\n        String dbPassword = \"yourpassword\";\n        String webGoatUser = \"exampleUser\"; // This should be dynamically obtained\n\n        try (Connection connection = DriverManager.getConnection(jdbcUrl, dbUser, dbPassword)) {\n            String sql = \"SET SCHEMA ?\";\n            try (PreparedStatement preparedStatement = connection.prepareStatement(sql)) {\n                preparedStatement.setString(1, webGoatUser);\n                preparedStatement.execute();\n                System.out.println(\"Schema set successfully.\");\n            }\n        } catch (SQLException e) {\n            e.printStackTrace();\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\n\n### Explanation of the Code:\n- **PreparedStatement**: This is used to safely set the schema by parameterizing the input, which prevents SQL injection.\n- **Connection**: Establishes a connection to the database.\n- **try-with-resources**: Ensures that resources are closed automatically.\n\n### Maven Dependencies (pom.xml):\nTo run this example, you need the MySQL JDBC driver. Below is the XML entry for the `pom.xml` file:\n\n```xml\n<dependencies>\n    <dependency>\n        <groupId>mysql</groupId>\n        <artifactId>mysql-connector-java</artifactId>\n        <version>8.0.33</version>\n    </dependency>\n</dependencies>\n```\n\n### Explanation of the Dependency:\n- **mysql-connector-java**: This is the JDBC driver for MySQL. It allows Java applications to connect to a MySQL database. Add this dependency inside the `<dependencies>` section of your `pom.xml` file.\n\n### Alternative JDBC Providers:\n- **PostgreSQL**: Use `org.postgresql:postgresql` for PostgreSQL databases.\n- **Oracle**: Use `com.oracle.database.jdbc:ojdbc8` for Oracle databases.\n- **SQL Server**: Use `com.microsoft.sqlserver:mssql-jdbc` for Microsoft SQL Server.\n\nEach of these providers has its own JDBC driver, which can be added to the `pom.xml` in a similar manner by specifying the appropriate `groupId`, `artifactId`, and `version`.\n\nThis example demonstrates how to use prepared statements to prevent SQL injection, ensuring that user input is safely handled.\n\n\n\n**References (SQL injection)**\n\n- [CAPEC-66: SQL Injection](https://capec.mitre.org/data/definitions/66.html)\n- [CWE-89: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an SQL Command ('SQL Injection')](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/89.html)\n- [OWASP: Top 10 A03_2021-Injection](https://owasp.org/Top10/A03_2021-Injection/)\n- [OWASP: SQL Injection Prevention Cheat Sheet](https://www.owasp.org/index.php/SQL_Injection_Prevention_Cheat_Sheet)\n- [OWASP: Query Parameterization Cheat Sheet](https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Query_Parameterization_Cheat_Sheet)\n\n\n"

                "markdown": "## Description\n\nFormat String Manipulation vulnerability in Java occurs when the output formatting operation is dynamically created without proper validation. This can lead to various security problems, including arbitrary memory access, stack corruption, and arbitrary code execution. This vulnerability is often exploited by attackers to manipulate the format string in order to read or write to arbitrary memory locations.\n\n## Mitigation Advice\n\nTo mitigate this vulnerability, it is recommended to:\n\n1. Avoid using user-supplied input in format strings.\n2. Use static format strings as much as possible.\n3. If dynamic format strings are necessary, ensure that user-supplied input is properly validated and sanitized.\n4. Use parameterized queries or prepared statements to prevent SQL injection attacks.\n\n## Source Code Fix Recommendation\n\nHere is an example of a vulnerable code:\n\n```java\nString username = request.getParameter(\"username\");\nSystem.out.printf(\"Hello, \" + username);\n```\n\nThe above code is vulnerable because it uses user-supplied input directly in a format string. An attacker could potentially manipulate the format string to cause a security breach.\n\nHere is a fixed version of the code:\n\n```java\nString username = request.getParameter(\"username\");\nSystem.out.printf(\"Hello, %s\", username);\n```\n\nIn the fixed version, a static format string is used, and the user-supplied input is used as a separate argument to the `printf` function. This prevents the user from being able to manipulate the format string.\n\n## OWASP Resources\n\nFor more information, you can refer to the following OWASP resources:\n\n- [OWASP Top 10 2017 Category A1: Injection](https://owasp.org/www-project-top-ten/2017/A1_2017-Injection)\n- [OWASP Java Encoder Project](https://owasp.org/www-project-java-encoder/)\n\n## Common Weakness Enumeration (CWE)\n\nThis vulnerability is related to:\n\n- [CWE-134: Use of Externally-Controlled Format String](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/134.html)"

Alternatively to prepare statements, each parameter can be escaped manually.\n\n**Solution (Prepared Statements):**\n\n```java\nString query = \"SELECT * FROM User WHERE id = ?\";\nPreparedStatement preparedStatement = connection.prepareStatement(query);\npreparedStatement.setString(1, inputId);\nResultSet resultSet = preparedStatement.executeQuery();\n```\n\n**Solution (Encoding):**\n\n```java\nimport org.owasp.esapi.Encoder;\ncreateQuery(\"select * from User where id = '\" + Encoder.encodeForSQL(inputId) + \"'\");\n```\n\n\n## In Context Remediation\n```java\nVulnerable Query: \"SET SCHEMA \\\"\" %2B (WebGoatUser) $obj0.getUsername() %2B \"\\\"\"\n\nRemediated Query: To fix SQL injection vulnerabilities in Java code, you should use `PreparedStatement` instead of concatenating SQL queries with user inputs. Here's how you can transform the given input into a safe version using `PreparedStatement`:\n\n### Input:\n```java\n\"SET SCHEMA \\\"\" + (WebGoatUser) $obj0.getUsername() + \"\\\"\"\n```\n\n### Output:\n```java\nString query = \"SET SCHEMA ?\";\nPreparedStatement statement = connection.prepareStatement(query);\nstatement.setString(1, ((WebGoatUser) $obj0).getUsername());\nstatement.executeUpdate();\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n1. **Parameterized Query**: Replace the direct concatenation of user input into the SQL query with a parameterized query using `?` placeholders.\n2. **PreparedStatement**: Use `PreparedStatement` to prepare the SQL query. This helps in preventing SQL injection by treating the input as data rather than executable code.\n3. **Set Parameters**: Use `setString` (or other appropriate `set` methods) to bind the user input to the query parameters. This ensures that the input is properly escaped and treated as a literal value.\n\nBy following these steps, you can effectively mitigate SQL injection vulnerabilities in your Java applications.\n```\nTo prevent SQL Injection using Prepared Statements, you can modify the vulnerable SQL query to use a `PreparedStatement` object. Below is a Java console application example demonstrating this approach:\n\n```java\nimport java.sql.Connection;\nimport java.sql.DriverManager;\nimport java.sql.PreparedStatement;\nimport java.sql.SQLException;\n\npublic class SQLInjectionPreventionExample {\n    public static void main(String[] args) {\n        String jdbcUrl = \"jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/yourdatabase\";\n        String dbUser = \"yourusername\";\n        String dbPassword = \"yourpassword\";\n        String webGoatUser = \"exampleUser\"; // This should be dynamically obtained\n\n        try (Connection connection = DriverManager.getConnection(jdbcUrl, dbUser, dbPassword)) {\n            String sql = \"SET SCHEMA ?\";\n            try (PreparedStatement preparedStatement = connection.prepareStatement(sql)) {\n                preparedStatement.setString(1, webGoatUser);\n                preparedStatement.execute();\n                System.out.println(\"Schema set successfully.\");\n            }\n        } catch (SQLException e) {\n            e.printStackTrace();\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\n\n### Explanation of the Code:\n- **PreparedStatement**: This is used to safely set the schema by parameterizing the input, which prevents SQL injection.\n- **Connection**: Establishes a connection to the database.\n- **try-with-resources**: Ensures that resources are closed automatically.\n\n### Maven Dependencies (pom.xml):\nTo run this example, you need the MySQL JDBC driver. Below is the XML entry for the `pom.xml` file:\n\n```xml\n<dependencies>\n    <dependency>\n        <groupId>mysql</groupId>\n        <artifactId>mysql-connector-java</artifactId>\n        <version>8.0.33</version>\n    </dependency>\n</dependencies>\n```\n\n### Explanation of the Dependency:\n- **mysql-connector-java**: This is the JDBC driver for MySQL. It allows Java applications to connect to a MySQL database. Add this dependency inside the `<dependencies>` section of your `pom.xml` file.\n\n### Alternative JDBC Providers:\n- **PostgreSQL**: Use `org.postgresql:postgresql` for PostgreSQL databases.\n- **Oracle**: Use `com.oracle.database.jdbc:ojdbc8` for Oracle databases.\n- **SQL Server**: Use `com.microsoft.sqlserver:mssql-jdbc` for Microsoft SQL Server.\n\nEach of these providers has its own JDBC driver, which can be added to the `pom.xml` in a similar manner by specifying the appropriate `groupId`, `artifactId`, and `version`.\n\nThis example demonstrates how to use prepared statements to prevent SQL injection, ensuring that user input is safely handled.\n\n\n\n**References (SQL injection)**\n\n- [CAPEC-66: SQL Injection](https://capec.mitre.org/data/definitions/66.html)\n- [CWE-89: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an SQL Command ('SQL Injection')](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/89.html)\n- [OWASP: Top 10 A03_2021-Injection](https://owasp.org/Top10/A03_2021-Injection/)\n- [OWASP: SQL Injection Prevention Cheat Sheet](https://www.owasp.org/index.php/SQL_Injection_Prevention_Cheat_Sheet)\n- [OWASP: Query Parameterization Cheat Sheet](https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Query_Parameterization_Cheat_Sheet)\n\n\n"

                "markdown": "## Description\n\nPredictable pseudorandom number generator vulnerability in Java occurs when a pseudorandom number generator (PRNG) is used in a way that makes it easy for an attacker to predict future outputs. PRNGs are algorithms that use mathematical formulas to produce sequences of random numbers. However, these sequences are deterministic and will repeat after a certain period. If an attacker can predict the sequence, they can use this information to compromise the security of the application.\n\n## Mitigation Advice\n\nTo mitigate this vulnerability, it is recommended to use a secure random number generator. In Java, you can use the `java.security.SecureRandom` class, which provides a cryptographically strong random number generator (RNG). \n\n## Source Code Fix Recommendation\n\nHere is an example of how to use `SecureRandom` in Java:\n\n```java\nimport java.security.SecureRandom;\n\npublic class SecureRandomDemo {\n    public static void main(String[] args) {\n        SecureRandom secureRandom = new SecureRandom();\n        int randomInt = secureRandom.nextInt();\n        System.out.println(\"Secure random integer: \" + randomInt);\n    }\n}\n```\n\nIn this code, `SecureRandom` is used to generate a secure random integer. This is much more secure than using `java.util.Random` or `Math.random()`, which are predictable and not suitable for generating security-sensitive random numbers.\n\n## OWASP Resources\n\nFor more information on this vulnerability, you can refer to the following OWASP resources:\n\n- [OWASP Top 10 2017 Category A6 - Security Misconfiguration](https://owasp.org/www-project-top-ten/2017/A6_2017-Security_Misconfiguration)\n- [OWASP Cheat Sheet Series - Random Number Generation](https://cheatsheetseries.owasp.org/cheatsheets/Random_Number_Generation_Cheat_Sheet.html)\n\n## Common Weakness Enumeration (CWE)\n\nThis vulnerability is related to:\n\n- [CWE-330: Use of Insufficiently Random Values](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/330.html)\n- [CWE-338: Use of Cryptographically Weak PRNG](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/338.html)"

This can occur when a program fails to properly handle Unicode encoding during string comparison operations.\n\nIn the provided code snippet, the vulnerability arises when the `equalsIgnoreCase` method is used to compare the `username` with the string \"admin\". This method is not Unicode-aware and can be bypassed by using different Unicode representations of the same string.\n\n## Mitigation Advice\n\nTo mitigate this vulnerability, it is recommended to normalize Unicode strings before performing comparisons. This can be achieved by using the `java.text.Normalizer` class in Java, which can convert Unicode text into an equivalent composed or decomposed form, allowing for correct string comparisons.\n\n## Source Code Fix Recommendation\n\nHere is a recommended fix for the provided code snippet:\n\n```java\nimport java.text.Normalizer;\n\n// ...\n\nString normalizedUsername = Normalizer.normalize(username, Normalizer.Form.NFC);\nif (normalizedUsername.equalsIgnoreCase(\"admin\")) {\n    // ...\n}\n```\n\nIn this code, the `normalize` method is used to convert the `username` into its composed form before performing the comparison.\n\n## Library Dependencies\n\nThe provided code snippet and its fix do not require any additional library dependencies beyond the standard Java libraries.\n\n## References\n\n- [OWASP - Insecure Comparison of Unicode Strings](https://cheatsheetseries.owasp.org/cheatsheets/Unicode_Cheat_Sheet.html)\n- [CWE-200: Information Exposure](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/200.html)"

It then validates the input using the `validateField7` method. This method checks if the input matches the regex pattern and if its length is between 1 and 7 characters. If both conditions are met, the method returns true; otherwise, it returns false.\n\nTo run this application, you need to have Java installed on your machine. You can compile the application using the `javac` command and run it using the `java` command. For example:\n\n```\njavac Main.java\njava Main\n```\n\nThis will compile the `Main.java` file and run the `Main` class. You will then be prompted to enter a value for \"field7\". After you enter a value, the application will tell you whether the validation was successful or not.\n\n\n\n## References\n- [OWASP: REST Security Cheat Sheet](https://cheatsheetseries.owasp.org/cheatsheets/REST_Security_Cheat_Sheet.html)\n- [OWASP: Input Validation Cheat Sheet](https://cheatsheetseries.owasp.org/cheatsheets/Input_Validation_Cheat_Sheet.html)\n- [OWASP: Bean Validation Cheat Sheet](https://cheatsheetseries.owasp.org/cheatsheets/Bean_Validation_Cheat_Sheet.html)\n\n\n"

                "markdown": "\nA path traversal attack (also known as directory traversal) aims to access files and directories that are stored outside the web root folder. By manipulating variables that reference files with “dot-dot-slash (../)” sequences and its variations or by using absolute file paths, it may be possible to access arbitrary files and directories stored on file system including application source code or configuration and critical system files.\n\nTo mitigate this vulnerability in Java, you can use path canonicalization and ensure that the resolved path is within a designated base directory. \n\n## Solution (Path Canonicalization)\n\n```java\n\n    // Base directory where files are allowed to be accessed\n    private static final String BASE_DIRECTORY = \"/safe/base/directory\";\n\n        /**\n         * Resolves the user input to a secure file path within the base directory.\n         *\n         * @param userInput The user-provided file path.\n         * @return A File object if the path is valid and within the base directory, otherwise null.\n         * @throws IOException If an error occurs during path resolution.\n         */\n        public static File getSecureFile(String userInput) throws IOException {\n            // Create a file object from the user input\n            File file = new File(BASE_DIRECTORY, userInput);\n\n            // Canonicalize the file path\n            String canonicalPath = file.getCanonicalPath();\n\n            // Check if the canonical path starts with the base directory path\n            if (canonicalPath.startsWith(new File(BASE_DIRECTORY).getCanonicalPath())) {\n                return file;\n            } else {\n                // The path is outside the base directory, deny access\n                return null;\n            }\n        }\n\n```\n\n\n## In Context Remediation\n```\nPath construction: new File(webGoatHomeDirectory, \"/ClientSideFiltering\")\nPath canonicalization: new File(webGoatHomeDirectory, \"/ClientSideFiltering\").getCanonicalPath()\n```\nHere is a simple Java console application that demonstrates how to securely canonicalize a file path. This application uses Apache Commons IO library to handle file operations.\n\n```java\nimport java.io.File;\nimport java.io.IOException;\nimport org.apache.commons.io.FileUtils;\n\npublic class SecureFileHandler {\n    private static final String webGoatHomeDirectory = \"/path/to/webgoat/home\";\n\n    public static void main(String[] args) {\n        try {\n            copyFiles();\n        } catch (IOException e) {\n            e.printStackTrace();\n        }\n    }\n\n    public static void copyFiles() throws IOException {\n        File baseDir = new File(webGoatHomeDirectory).getCanonicalFile();\n        File targetDir = new File(baseDir, \"/ClientSideFiltering\").getCanonicalFile();\n\n        if (!targetDir.getPath().startsWith(baseDir.getPath())) {\n            throw new IOException(\"Target directory is outside of the base directory\");\n        }\n\n        // Copy files from base directory to target directory\n        FileUtils.copyDirectory(baseDir, targetDir);\n    }\n}\n```\n\nThis application uses the `getCanonicalFile()` method to canonicalize the file paths. It then checks if the target directory is within the base directory by comparing their canonical paths. If the target directory is outside of the base directory, it throws an IOException.\n\nDependencies needed to run this application:\n\n- Java Development Kit (JDK) 8 or later\n- Apache Commons IO library\n\nYou can add the Apache Commons IO library to your project using the following Maven dependency:\n\n```xml\n<dependency>\n    <groupId>commons-io</groupId>\n    <artifactId>commons-io</artifactId>\n    <version>2.8.0</version>\n</dependency>\n```\n\nPlease replace \"/path/to/webgoat/home\" with the actual path to your WebGoat home directory.\n\n\n\n## References\n- [OWASP: Path Traversal](https://owasp.org/www-community/attacks/Path_Traversal)\n- [OWASP: Input Validation Cheat Sheet](https://cheatsheetseries.owasp.org/cheatsheets/Input_Validation_Cheat_Sheet.html)\n- [CWE-22: Improper Limitation of a Pathname to a Restricted Directory ('Path Traversal')](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/22.html)\n\n\n"

This vulnerability can occur when a program does not correctly convert Unicode or other encoded data into its canonical equivalent.\n\nIn the specific case of `modulus.toUpperCase()`, the vulnerability can occur if the `modulus` string contains special Unicode characters that have different meanings in uppercase and lowercase. When transformed to uppercase, these characters can cause unexpected behavior.\n\n## Mitigation Advice\n\nTo mitigate this vulnerability, it is recommended to use locale-specific transformations when converting strings to uppercase or lowercase. This can be done by using the `toUpperCase(Locale locale)` or `toLowerCase(Locale locale)` methods in Java, which take a `Locale` object as a parameter.\n\n## Source Code Fix Recommendation\n\nHere is a recommended fix for the `modulus.toUpperCase()` vulnerability:\n\n```java\nimport java.util.Locale;\n\n// ...\n\nString modulus = \"some string\";\nString upperModulus = modulus.toUpperCase(Locale.ROOT);\n```\n\nIn this example, `Locale.ROOT` is used as the locale, which represents the root (or no) locale. This will ensure that the transformation is done in a locale-insensitive manner, preventing any unexpected behavior due to special Unicode characters.\n\n## Library Dependencies\n\nThe above code example requires the following library dependencies:\n\n- `java.util.Locale`\n\n## References\n\n- [OWASP - Insecure Direct Object References](https://owasp.org/www-project-top-ten/2017/A5_2017-Broken_Access_Control)\n- [CWE-176: Improper Handling of Unicode Encoding](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/176.html)"

                "markdown": "\nA path traversal attack (also known as directory traversal) aims to access files and directories that are stored outside the web root folder. By manipulating variables that reference files with “dot-dot-slash (../)” sequences and its variations or by using absolute file paths, it may be possible to access arbitrary files and directories stored on file system including application source code or configuration and critical system files.\n\nTo mitigate this vulnerability in Java, you can use path canonicalization and ensure that the resolved path is within a designated base directory. \n\n## Solution (Path Canonicalization)\n\n```java\n\n    // Base directory where files are allowed to be accessed\n    private static final String BASE_DIRECTORY = \"/safe/base/directory\";\n\n        /**\n         * Resolves the user input to a secure file path within the base directory.\n         *\n         * @param userInput The user-provided file path.\n         * @return A File object if the path is valid and within the base directory, otherwise null.\n         * @throws IOException If an error occurs during path resolution.\n         */\n        public static File getSecureFile(String userInput) throws IOException {\n            // Create a file object from the user input\n            File file = new File(BASE_DIRECTORY, userInput);\n\n            // Canonicalize the file path\n            String canonicalPath = file.getCanonicalPath();\n\n            // Check if the canonical path starts with the base directory path\n            if (canonicalPath.startsWith(new File(BASE_DIRECTORY).getCanonicalPath())) {\n                return file;\n            } else {\n                // The path is outside the base directory, deny access\n                return null;\n            }\n        }\n\n```\n\n\n## In Context Remediation\n```\nPath construction: new File(webGoatHomeDirectory, \"ClientSideFiltering/employees.xml\")\nPath canonicalization: new File(webGoatHomeDirectory, \"ClientSideFiltering/employees.xml\").getCanonicalPath()\n```\nHere is a simple Java console application that demonstrates how to securely canonicalize a file path. This application uses Apache Commons IO library to handle file path canonicalization.\n\n```java\nimport java.io.File;\nimport java.io.IOException;\nimport org.apache.commons.io.FilenameUtils;\n\npublic class FilePathCanonicalization {\n    public static void main(String[] args) {\n        String webGoatHomeDirectory = \"/home/webgoat\";\n        String userProvidedPath = \"ClientSideFiltering/employees.xml\"; // This should be provided by the user\n\n        File file = new File(webGoatHomeDirectory, userProvidedPath);\n        try {\n            String canonicalPath = file.getCanonicalPath();\n            String basePath = new File(webGoatHomeDirectory).getCanonicalPath();\n\n            if (FilenameUtils.directoryContains(basePath, canonicalPath)) {\n                System.out.println(\"File is within the intended directory\");\n            } else {\n                System.out.println(\"File is not within the intended directory\");\n            }\n        } catch (IOException e) {\n            e.printStackTrace();\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\n\nThis application first creates a `File` object with the base directory and the user-provided path. It then gets the canonical paths of both the base directory and the file. It checks if the file's canonical path is within the base directory's canonical path using `FilenameUtils.directoryContains()` method. If it is, it prints \"File is within the intended directory\". If it's not, it prints \"File is not within the intended directory\".\n\nDependencies needed to run this application:\n\n- Java Development Kit (JDK) 8 or later\n- Apache Commons IO library\n\nYou can add Apache Commons IO library to your project using Maven by adding the following dependency to your `pom.xml` file:\n\n```xml\n<dependency>\n    <groupId>commons-io</groupId>\n    <artifactId>commons-io</artifactId>\n    <version>2.8.0</version>\n</dependency>\n```\n\nOr, if you're using Gradle, add this to your `build.gradle` file:\n\n```gradle\ndependencies {\n    implementation 'commons-io:commons-io:2.8.0'\n}\n```\n\nRemember to replace the version number with the latest version of Apache Commons IO library.\n\n\n\n## References\n- [OWASP: Path Traversal](https://owasp.org/www-community/attacks/Path_Traversal)\n- [OWASP: Input Validation Cheat Sheet](https://cheatsheetseries.owasp.org/cheatsheets/Input_Validation_Cheat_Sheet.html)\n- [CWE-22: Improper Limitation of a Pathname to a Restricted Directory ('Path Traversal')](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/22.html)\n\n\n"

This can lead to timing attacks as the `equals()` method in Java does not have a constant time complexity. An attacker can measure the time it takes to compare two hashes and use this information to guess the hashed value.\n\n## Mitigation Advice\n\nTo mitigate this vulnerability, you should use a constant time comparison method.

This can lead to unexpected behavior and potential security issues. The `equals()` method is used to determine if two objects are equal, while the `hashCode()` method is used to compute a hash value for an object. If these methods are not correctly overridden, two objects that are logically equal may not be treated as equal by collections such as `HashSet`, `HashMap`, etc.\n\n## Mitigation Advice\n\nTo mitigate this vulnerability, ensure that you override both `equals()` and `hashCode()` methods in your classes, especially if they are used in collections. The `equals()` method should be used to determine if two objects are logically equal, and the `hashCode()` method should return the same hash value for two equal objects.\n\n## Code Fix Recommendation\n\nHere is an example of how to correctly override `equals()` and `hashCode()` methods in a class:\n\n```java\npublic class MyClass {\n    private int id;\n    private String name;\n\n    // constructors, getters and setters...\n\n    @Override\n    public boolean equals(Object obj) {\n        if (this == obj)\n            return true;\n        if (obj == null || getClass() != obj.getClass())\n            return false;\n        MyClass myClass = (MyClass) obj;\n        return id == myClass.id && name.equals(myClass.name);\n    }\n\n    @Override\n    public int hashCode() {\n        return Objects.hash(id, name);\n    }\n}\n```\n\nIn this example, `equals()` checks if the `id` and `name` fields are equal, and `hashCode()` returns a hash value that is based on the `id` and `name` fields. This ensures that two `MyClass` objects are treated as equal if their `id` and `name` fields are equal.\n\n## Library Dependencies\n\nThe above code example does not require any additional library dependencies.\n\n## References\n\n- [OWASP Top 10 - A3:2017-Sensitive Data Exposure](https://owasp.org/www-project-top-ten/2017/A3_2017-Sensitive_Data_Exposure)\n- [CWE-597: Use of Wrong Operator in String Comparison](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/597.html)"

This can occur when a program does not correctly convert Unicode, UTF-8, and UTF-16 data, leading to information disclosure, denial of service, or potentially the execution of arbitrary code.\n\nThis vulnerability can be exploited by an attacker to bypass input validation checks, inject malicious code, or cause the application to behave unexpectedly. It can also lead to issues with data integrity and confidentiality.\n\n## Mitigation Advice\n\nTo mitigate this vulnerability, it is recommended to:\n\n1. Always validate and sanitize input data: Ensure that all input data is validated and sanitized before it is processed. This can help to prevent injection attacks.\n\n2. Use secure coding practices: Follow secure coding practices to prevent this vulnerability. This includes using parameterized queries, prepared statements, or stored procedures whenever possible.\n\n3. Use the latest version of Java: Always use the latest version of Java, as it includes the most up-to-date security patches and fixes.\n\n4. Use a security-focused development lifecycle: Incorporate security into every stage of the software development lifecycle. This includes conducting regular security reviews and testing.\n\n## Source Code Fix Recommendation\n\nIn Java, you can use the `Normalizer` class to normalize Unicode text. Here is an example:\n\n```java\nimport java.text.Normalizer;\nimport java.text.Normalizer.Form;\n\npublic class Main {\n    public static void main(String[] args) {\n        String s = \"Your String Here\";\n        String normalized = Normalizer.normalize(s, Form.NFC);\n        System.out.println(normalized);\n    }\n}\n```\n\nIn this example, the `normalize` method is used to transform the Unicode text into its canonical form.

Common weak hash functions include MD5 and SHA-1, which are considered insecure due to vulnerabilities that allow for collision attacks.\n\nTo mitigate this vulnerability, you should use a strong hash function, such as SHA-256, and apply additional security measures like salting and key stretching.\n\n## Solution (Use secure algorithm)\n\n```java\n\nMessageDigest md = MessageDigest.getInstance(\"SHA-256\");\n\n```\n\n\n## In Context Remediation\n```\nVulnerable digest algorithm: \"MD5\"\nSecure digest algorithm: \"SHA-256\"\n```\nSHA-256 (Secure Hash Algorithm 256 bit) is a cryptographic hash function that produces a 256-bit (32-byte) hash value. It is a member of the SHA-2 family and is widely used in security applications and protocols, including TLS and SSL, PGP, SSH, IPsec, and more. It is considered secure because it is computationally infeasible to generate the same hash output from two different input values or to regenerate the original input value from the hash output.\n\nHere is a simple Java console application that uses SHA-256 to hash a string:\n\n```java\nimport java.security.MessageDigest;\nimport java.security.NoSuchAlgorithmException;\n\npublic class Main {\n    public static void main(String[] args) throws NoSuchAlgorithmException {\n        String originalString = \"Hello, World!\";\n        MessageDigest digest = MessageDigest.getInstance(\"SHA-256\");\n        byte[] encodedhash = digest.digest(originalString.getBytes());\n        System.out.println(bytesToHex(encodedhash));\n    }\n\n    private static String bytesToHex(byte[] hash) {\n        StringBuffer hexString = new StringBuffer();\n        for (int i = 0; i < hash.length; i++) {\n            String hex = Integer.toHexString(0xff & hash[i]);\n            if(hex.length() == 1) hexString.append('0');\n            hexString.append(hex);\n        }\n        return hexString.toString();\n    }\n}\n```\n\nThis program first gets an instance of the MessageDigest class for the SHA-256 algorithm. It then hashes the input string and converts the resulting byte array to a hexadecimal string for display.\n\nTo run this application, you need the Java Development Kit (JDK) installed on your machine. You can download it from the official Oracle website. After installing the JDK, you can compile the program with the `javac` command and run it with the `java` command.\n\nPlease note that the `getMd5` method in the `org.owasp.webgoat.lessons.cryptography.HashingAssignment` class, as the name suggests, is intended to use the MD5 algorithm, not SHA-256. MD5 is considered to be less secure than SHA-256 due to its vulnerability to collision attacks. Therefore, it's recommended to use SHA-256 or another secure hash function instead of MD5 for most purposes.\n\n\n\n## References\n- [OWASP: A02 2021 – Cryptographic Failures](https://owasp.org/Top10/A02_2021-Cryptographic_Failures/)\n- [OWASP: Cryptographic Storage Cheat Sheet](https://cheatsheetseries.owasp.org/cheatsheets/Cryptographic_Storage_Cheat_Sheet.html)\n- [CWE-328: Use of Weak Hash](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/328.html)\n\n\n"

If the password is valid, it prints \"Password is valid.\" If the password is invalid, it prints \"Password is invalid.\"\n\nTo run this application, you need to have Java installed on your machine. You can compile the application with the command `javac Main.java` and run it with the command `java Main`.\n\nPlease note that this is a simple console application and does not include the full context of the `HashingAssignment` class or the `AttackResult` method.

This vulnerability is often caused by the incorrect use of Unicode transformation methods, such as `toUpperCase()` and `toLowerCase()`, which do not take into account locale-specific rules and can result in incorrect transformations.\n\nIn the provided sink `tempModulus.toUpperCase()`, the `toUpperCase()` method is used without specifying a locale. This can lead to unexpected results when the code is run in different locales, as the method will use the default locale of the JVM, which can vary depending on the system configuration.\n\n## Mitigation Advice\n\nTo mitigate this vulnerability, always specify a locale when using Unicode transformation methods. For English text, you can use `Locale.ENGLISH` to ensure consistent results across all locales.\n\n## Source Code Fix Recommendation\n\nHere is a recommended fix for the provided sink:\n\n```java\nimport java.util.Locale;\n\n// ...\n\nString tempModulus = ...;\ntempModulus = tempModulus.toUpperCase(Locale.ENGLISH);\n```\n\n## Library Dependencies\n\nThe code example does not require any additional library dependencies beyond the standard Java libraries.\n\n## References\n\n- [OWASP - Insecure Direct Object References](https://owasp.org/www-project-top-ten/2017/A5_2017-Broken_Access_Control)\n- [CWE-704: Incorrect Type Conversion or Cast](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/704.html)"

This application uses the Java standard library, so no additional dependencies are needed.\n\n```java\nimport java.util.Scanner;\nimport java.util.regex.Pattern;\n\npublic class Main {\n    public static void main(String[] args) {\n        Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);\n        System.out.println(\"Enter the signature:\");\n        String signature = scanner.nextLine();\n        if (validateSignature(signature)) {\n            System.out.println(\"Signature is valid.\");\n        } else {\n            System.out.println(\"Signature is invalid.\");\n        }\n        scanner.close();\n    }\n\n    public static boolean validateSignature(String signature) {\n        String regex = \"^[a-fA-F0-9]+$\";\n        return Pattern.matches(regex, signature) && signature.length() >= 8 && signature.length() <= 64;\n    }\n}\n```\n\nTo run this application, you need to have Java installed on your machine. You can compile and run the application using the following commands:\n\n```bash\njavac Main.java\njava Main\n```\n\nWhen the application runs, it will prompt you to enter the signature. After you enter the signature, it will validate it and print whether it is valid or not. The validation checks if the signature matches the regex pattern and if its length is between 8 and 64 characters.\n\n\n\n## References\n- [OWASP: REST Security Cheat Sheet](https://cheatsheetseries.owasp.org/cheatsheets/REST_Security_Cheat_Sheet.html)\n- [OWASP: Input Validation Cheat Sheet](https://cheatsheetseries.owasp.org/cheatsheets/Input_Validation_Cheat_Sheet.html)\n- [OWASP: Bean Validation Cheat Sheet](https://cheatsheetseries.owasp.org/cheatsheets/Bean_Validation_Cheat_Sheet.html)\n\n\n"

PRNGs are algorithms that use mathematical formulas to produce sequences of random numbers. However, these sequences are deterministic and will repeat after a certain period. If an attacker can predict the sequence, they can use this information to compromise the security of the application.\n\n## Mitigation Advice\n\nTo mitigate this vulnerability, it is recommended to use a secure random number generator. In Java, you can use the `java.security.SecureRandom` class, which provides a cryptographically strong random number generator (RNG). \n\n## Source Code Fix Recommendation\n\nHere is an example of how to use `SecureRandom` in Java:\n\n```java\nimport java.security.SecureRandom;\n\npublic class SecureRandomDemo {\n    public static void main(String[] args) {\n        SecureRandom secureRandom = new SecureRandom();\n        int randomInt = secureRandom.nextInt();\n        System.out.println(\"Secure random integer: \" + randomInt);\n    }\n}\n```\n\nIn this code, `SecureRandom` is used to generate a secure random integer. This is much more secure than using `java.util.Random` or `Math.random()`, which are predictable and not suitable for generating security-sensitive random numbers.\n\n## OWASP Resources\n\nFor more information on this vulnerability, you can refer to the following OWASP resources:\n\n- [OWASP Top 10 2017 Category A6 - Security Misconfiguration](https://owasp.org/www-project-top-ten/2017/A6_2017-Security_Misconfiguration)\n- [OWASP Cheat Sheet Series - Random Number Generation](https://cheatsheetseries.owasp.org/cheatsheets/Random_Number_Generation_Cheat_Sheet.html)\n\n## Common Weakness Enumeration (CWE)\n\nThis vulnerability is related to:\n\n- [CWE-330: Use of Insufficiently Random Values](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/330.html)\n- [CWE-338: Use of Cryptographically Weak PRNG](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/338.html)"

This can lead to a variety of security issues, as an attacker who can predict the PRNG output can often bypass security measures that rely on random values, such as tokens, nonces, and keys.\n\nIn Java, the `ThreadLocalRandom` class is used to generate pseudorandom numbers. However, it is not cryptographically secure, which means that its output can be predicted if the initial seed is known. This makes it unsuitable for use in security-sensitive contexts.\n\n## Mitigation Advice\n\nTo mitigate this vulnerability, use a cryptographically secure pseudorandom number generator (CSPRNG) instead of `ThreadLocalRandom`. In Java, the `SecureRandom` class can be used for this purpose. It provides a cryptographically strong random number generator (RNG).\n\n## Source Code Fix Recommendation\n\nReplace the use of `ThreadLocalRandom` with `SecureRandom`:\n\n```java\nimport java.security.SecureRandom;\nimport java.util.function.Predicate;\n\n// ...\n\nPredicate<Double> PROBABILITY_DOUBLE_PREDICATE = ...;\n\nSecureRandom random = new SecureRandom();\nif (!PROBABILITY_DOUBLE_PREDICATE.test(random.nextDouble())) {\n    // ...\n}\n```\n\n## Library Dependencies\n\nThe code example requires the following library dependencies:\n\n- `java.util.function.Predicate`\n- `java.security.SecureRandom`\n\n## References\n\n- [OWASP: Insecure Randomness](https://owasp.org/www-community/vulnerabilities/Insecure_Randomness)\n- [CWE-330: Use of Insufficiently Random Values](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/330.html)"

This can lead to various security issues such as information disclosure, bypassing input validation checks, and even remote code execution. \n\nIn Java, Unicode transformations are typically handled using the `java.text.Normalizer` class. However, if these transformations are not managed correctly, it can lead to vulnerabilities. For example, if the application relies on the Unicode normalization form C (NFC) and the input is in a different form (like NFD, NFKD, or NFKC), it can lead to unexpected behavior.\n\n## Mitigation Advice\n\nTo mitigate this vulnerability, you should always normalize Unicode input to a specific form before processing it. This can be done using the `java.text.Normalizer` class in Java. \n\nAdditionally, you should also validate all input to ensure it meets your application's requirements. This can help prevent other types of input-related vulnerabilities.\n\n## Source Code Fix Recommendation\n\nHere is how you can normalize Unicode input in Java:\n\n```java\nimport java.text.Normalizer;\n\nString normalizedAnswer = Normalizer.normalize(answer, Normalizer.Form.NFC);\nString normalizedMagicNum = Normalizer.normalize(magic_num, Normalizer.Form.NFC);\n\nif (\"POST\".equalsIgnoreCase(normalizedAnswer) && magic_answer.equals(normalizedMagicNum)) {\n    // ...\n}\n```\n\n## Library Dependencies\n\nThe code example does not require any additional library dependencies to execute properly. The `java.text.Normalizer` class is part of the standard Java library.\n\n## OWASP and CWE Resources\n\n- [OWASP Unicode Transformation Issues](https://cheatsheetseries.owasp.org/cheatsheets/Unicode.html)\n- [CWE-176: Improper Handling of Unicode Encoding](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/176.html)"

If the password is valid, it prints \"Password is valid.\" If the password is not valid, it prints \"Password is invalid.\"\n\nDependencies:\n- Java Development Kit (JDK) 8 or later\n\nTo run this application, you need to have the JDK installed on your machine. You can compile the application with the `javac` command and run it with the `java` command. For example:\n\n```bash\njavac PasswordValidation.java\njava PasswordValidation\n```\n\nPlease note that the provided regex pattern and the requirement \"Length of the parameter value must be between 8 and 8 characters long\" are contradictory. The regex pattern allows passwords of 8 or more characters, while the requirement specifies a length of exactly 8 characters. The code above follows the regex pattern. If you want to enforce a length of exactly 8 characters, you can change the `{8,}` in the regex pattern to `{8}`.\n\n\n\n## References\n- [OWASP: REST Security Cheat Sheet](https://cheatsheetseries.owasp.org/cheatsheets/REST_Security_Cheat_Sheet.html)\n- [OWASP: Input Validation Cheat Sheet](https://cheatsheetseries.owasp.org/cheatsheets/Input_Validation_Cheat_Sheet.html)\n- [OWASP: Bean Validation Cheat Sheet](https://cheatsheetseries.owasp.org/cheatsheets/Bean_Validation_Cheat_Sheet.html)\n\n\n"

This is because Unicode transformations can change the length of a string, which can lead to buffer overflows, or they can change the string's content in ways that can be exploited by an attacker. For example, an attacker might be able to bypass security checks by using a Unicode transformation that changes a forbidden string into an allowed one.\n\nIn the provided code, the vulnerability lies in the use of the `toLowerCase()` and `trim()` methods. These methods are used to normalize the input, but they do not handle Unicode correctly. This can lead to unexpected behavior if the input contains Unicode characters.\n\n## Mitigation Advice\n\nTo mitigate this vulnerability, you should use Unicode-aware methods for string comparison. In Java, you can use the `equalsIgnoreCase()` method, which correctly handles Unicode characters. You should also use the `trim()` method to remove leading and trailing whitespace before comparing strings.\n\n## Source Code Fix Recommendation\n\nHere is a fixed version of the provided code:\n\n```java\nif (diffAttribs[0].trim().equalsIgnoreCase(\"userid\") && diffAttribs[1].trim().equalsIgnoreCase(\"role\") || diffAttribs[1].trim().equalsIgnoreCase(\"userid\") && diffAttribs[0].trim().equalsIgnoreCase(\"role\"))\n```\n\n## Library Dependencies\n\nThe provided code does not require any additional library dependencies to execute properly.

This can lead to unexpected behavior and potential security vulnerabilities, such as bypassing security checks or causing application crashes.\n\nIn the provided code snippet, the vulnerability arises from the use of `toLowerCase()` method. This method is locale-dependent and can produce unexpected results with certain Unicode characters. For example, the Turkish locale has unique rules for converting 'I' to lower case, which can lead to unexpected results when compared to other locales.\n\n## Mitigation Advice\n\nTo mitigate this vulnerability, it is recommended to use locale-independent methods for case conversions. In Java, you can use `toLowerCase(Locale.ROOT)` or `toUpperCase(Locale.ROOT)` for this purpose. These methods will consistently convert characters to lower or upper case, regardless of the system's current locale.\n\n## Source Code Fix Recommendation\n\nHere is the fixed version of the provided code snippet:\n\n```java\ndiffAttribs[1].toLowerCase(Locale.ROOT).trim().equals(\"role\")\n```\n\n## Library Dependencies\n\nThe provided code snippet does not require any additional library dependencies to execute properly.\n\n## References\n\n- [OWASP - Insecure Direct Object References](https://owasp.org/www-project-top-ten/2017/A5_2017-Broken_Access_Control)\n- [CWE-807: Reliance on Untrusted Inputs in a Security Decision](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/807.html)"

This vulnerability occurs when a program does not correctly convert Unicode or non-Unicode characters to their proper Unicode equivalents. This can lead to unexpected behavior, as the same character can be represented in different ways in Unicode.\n\n## Mitigation Advice\n\nTo mitigate this vulnerability, it is recommended to use the appropriate Unicode normalization form. Java provides the `java.text.Normalizer` class, which can be used to transform Unicode text into an equivalent composed or decomposed form, allowing for easier comparison, searching, and sorting of text.\n\n## Source Code Fix Recommendation\n\nHere is a code fix for the specific vulnerability sink:\n\n```java\nimport java.text.Normalizer;\n\nString role = Normalizer.normalize(diffAttribs[0], Normalizer.Form.NFD);\nif (role.toLowerCase().trim().equals(\"role\")) {\n    // ...\n}\n```\n\nIn this code, `Normalizer.normalize()` is used to convert the string to its decomposed form, where each base character and combining character are separate.

This application uses the Java's built-in classes, so no additional dependencies are needed.\n\n```java\nimport java.util.Scanner;\nimport java.util.regex.Pattern;\n\npublic class Main {\n    public static void main(String[] args) {\n        Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);\n        System.out.println(\"Enter magic_num: \");\n        String magic_num = scanner.nextLine();\n        if (isValidMagicNum(magic_num)) {\n            System.out.println(\"Valid magic_num\");\n        } else {\n            System.out.println(\"Invalid magic_num\");\n        }\n        scanner.close();\n    }\n\n    public static boolean isValidMagicNum(String magic_num) {\n        String regex = \"^[0-9]+$\";\n        return Pattern.matches(regex, magic_num) && magic_num.length() >= 1 && magic_num.length() <= 9;\n    }\n}\n```\n\nThis application prompts the user to enter a \"magic_num\". It then validates the input using the `isValidMagicNum` method. This method checks if the input matches the regex pattern \"^[0-9]+$\" (which means it should only contain digits) and if its length is between 1 and 9 characters. If the input is valid, it prints \"Valid magic_num\", otherwise it prints \"Invalid magic_num\".\n\nTo run this application, you need to have Java installed on your machine. You can compile the application using the `javac` command and run it using the `java` command. For example:\n\n```\njavac Main.java\njava Main\n```\n\nThis will compile the `Main.java` file and run the `Main` class.\n\n\n\n## References\n- [OWASP: REST Security Cheat Sheet](https://cheatsheetseries.owasp.org/cheatsheets/REST_Security_Cheat_Sheet.html)\n- [OWASP: Input Validation Cheat Sheet](https://cheatsheetseries.owasp.org/cheatsheets/Input_Validation_Cheat_Sheet.html)\n- [OWASP: Bean Validation Cheat Sheet](https://cheatsheetseries.owasp.org/cheatsheets/Bean_Validation_Cheat_Sheet.html)\n\n\n"

This is a bad practice because it exposes the password to anyone who has access to the code. In addition, if the password is used in multiple places, it becomes difficult to change it without modifying and recompiling the code in all those places.\n\nIn the provided Java code snippet, the password \"cat\" is hard-coded for the user \"tom\". This is a clear example of this vulnerability.\n\n## Mitigation Advice\n\nTo mitigate this vulnerability, avoid hard-coding sensitive data directly into your source code. Instead, use secure methods of storing and retrieving these data, such as environment variables, configuration files, or secure password vaults. These methods allow you to change the password without modifying the code, and they can protect the password from unauthorized access.\n\n## Source Code Fix Recommendation\n\nHere is a simple way to fix the provided code snippet:\n\n```java\nString user = \"tom\";\nString password = System.getenv(\"PASSWORD_FOR_\" + user.toUpperCase());\nthis.idorUserInfo.get(user).put(\"password\", password);\n```\n\nIn this revised code, the password is retrieved from an environment variable named \"PASSWORD_FOR_TOM\". This environment variable should be set in a secure manner, outside of the source code.\n\n## Library Dependencies\n\nThe provided code snippet does not specify any library dependencies. However, it appears to use a `Map` object (`idorUserInfo`) that is part of the standard Java library.\n\n## References\n\n- [OWASP: Password in Configuration File](https://owasp.org/www-project-top-ten/2017/A2_2017-Broken_Authentication)\n- [CWE-259: Use of Hard-coded Password](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/259.html)"

This is a bad practice because it exposes the password to anyone who has access to the source code. In addition, if the password needs to be changed, the source code must be updated and recompiled, which is not practical in a production environment.\n\nIn the provided Java code snippet, the password \"buffalo\" is hard-coded for the user \"bill\". This is a clear example of the \"Password Embedded in Code\" vulnerability.\n\n## Mitigation Advice\n\nTo mitigate this vulnerability, sensitive data such as passwords should never be hard-coded into the source code. Instead, they should be stored securely and retrieved as needed. This can be achieved by using environment variables, configuration files, or secure password vaults. \n\nIn addition, it's recommended to use strong encryption to protect sensitive data, and to use secure methods for transmitting and storing passwords.\n\n## Source Code Fix Recommendation\n\nA better approach would be to retrieve the password from a secure source at runtime. Here is an example of how you might modify the code:\n\n```java\nimport java.util.Properties;\n\npublic class Main {\n    public static void main(String[] args) {\n        Properties properties = new Properties();\n        properties.load(new FileInputStream(\"config.properties\"));\n        String password = properties.getProperty(\"bill.password\");\n        this.idorUserInfo.get(\"bill\").put(\"password\", password);\n    }\n}\n```\n\nIn this example, the password for the user \"bill\" is stored in a properties file named \"config.properties\". The password is loaded at runtime and used to update the `idorUserInfo` map.\n\n## Library Dependencies\n\nThe provided code snippet does not provide enough context to determine the exact library dependencies. However, the `Properties` class used in the fix recommendation is part of the `java.util` package, which is included in the Java standard library.\n\n## References\n\n- [OWASP: Password in Configuration File](https://owasp.org/www-project-top-ten/2017/A2_2017-Broken_Authentication)\n- [CWE-259: Use of Hard-coded Password](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/259.html)"

This application uses the Java's built-in `Pattern` and `Matcher` classes for regex matching.\n\n```java\nimport java.util.regex.Matcher;\nimport java.util.regex.Pattern;\n\npublic class Main {\n\n    public static void main(String[] args) {\n        String user = \"test\"; // replace with the user input\n        System.out.println(validateUser(user));\n    }\n\n    public static boolean validateUser(String user) {\n        String pattern = \"^[a-zA-Z0-9._%+-]+$\";\n        Pattern compiledPattern = Pattern.compile(pattern);\n        Matcher matcher = compiledPattern.matcher(user);\n        return matcher.matches() && user.length() >= 1 && user.length() <= 4;\n    }\n}\n```\n\nThis application doesn't require any additional dependencies, it only uses Java's built-in libraries. You can run this application with any Java 8+ JDK.\n\nPlease note that this is a simple console application for demonstration purposes. In a real-world application, you would probably want to handle the validation in a more sophisticated way, for example by throwing an exception or returning a detailed error message if the validation fails. Also, the user input would typically come from a web form or a similar source, not a hardcoded string.\n\n\n\n## References\n- [OWASP: REST Security Cheat Sheet](https://cheatsheetseries.owasp.org/cheatsheets/REST_Security_Cheat_Sheet.html)\n- [OWASP: Input Validation Cheat Sheet](https://cheatsheetseries.owasp.org/cheatsheets/Input_Validation_Cheat_Sheet.html)\n- [OWASP: Bean Validation Cheat Sheet](https://cheatsheetseries.owasp.org/cheatsheets/Bean_Validation_Cheat_Sheet.html)\n\n\n"

This can lead to various security issues such as bypassing string-based security checks, causing information leakage, or even leading to code execution.\n\nIn the context of the provided code snippet, if the user input is not properly sanitized and normalized, it could lead to security vulnerabilities. For example, Unicode provides multiple ways to represent the same visual character. If the input is not normalized, a string-based security check might fail.\n\n## Mitigation Advice\n\nTo mitigate this vulnerability, it is recommended to normalize Unicode inputs before performing string-based security checks. Java provides the `java.text.Normalizer` class for this purpose. \n\n## Source Code Fix Recommendation\n\nHere is a fixed version of the provided code snippet:\n\n```java\nimport java.text.Normalizer;\n\n// ...\n\nString normalizedUser = Normalizer.normalize(user, Normalizer.Form.NFC);\nif (\"Jerry\".equalsIgnoreCase(normalizedUser) && PASSWORD.equals(password)) {\n    // ...\n}\n```\n\n## Library Dependencies\n\nThe provided code snippet does not require any additional library dependencies to execute properly.\n\n## References\n\n- [OWASP - Unicode Transformation Issues](https://cheatsheetseries.owasp.org/cheatsheets/Unicode.html)\n- [CWE-176: Improper Handling of Unicode Encoding](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/176.html)"

The `isValidPassword` method uses the provided regex pattern to check if the password contains at least one digit, one lowercase letter, one uppercase letter, one special character, no whitespace, and is exactly 8 characters long.\n\nDependencies:\n- Java Development Kit (JDK) 8 or later\n\nTo run this application, you need to have the JDK installed on your machine. You can compile the application with the `javac` command and run it with the `java` command. For example:\n\n```bash\njavac Main.java\njava Main\n```\n\nThis will start the application, and you can then enter a password to check if it's valid.\n\n\n\n## References\n- [OWASP: REST Security Cheat Sheet](https://cheatsheetseries.owasp.org/cheatsheets/REST_Security_Cheat_Sheet.html)\n- [OWASP: Input Validation Cheat Sheet](https://cheatsheetseries.owasp.org/cheatsheets/Input_Validation_Cheat_Sheet.html)\n- [OWASP: Bean Validation Cheat Sheet](https://cheatsheetseries.owasp.org/cheatsheets/Bean_Validation_Cheat_Sheet.html)\n\n\n"

This vulnerability can occur when Unicode strings are compared or converted without proper normalization, allowing attackers to exploit discrepancies in how different systems interpret Unicode characters.\n\n### General Mitigation Advice\n\n1. **Normalize Unicode Strings**: Always normalize Unicode strings to a standard form before processing or comparison. Use `java.text.Normalizer` to ensure consistent handling of Unicode characters.\n\n2. **Use Locale-Sensitive Methods**: When performing string operations, use locale-sensitive methods to avoid unexpected behavior due to locale-specific rules.\n\n3. **Validate Input**: Implement strict input validation to ensure that only expected characters are processed.\n\n4. **Security Libraries**: Utilize well-established security libraries that handle Unicode safely and provide built-in protection against common vulnerabilities.\n\n### Source Code Fix Recommendation\n\nTo mitigate the vulnerability in the specific code example, ensure that both strings are normalized before comparison:\n\n```java\nimport java.text.Normalizer;\nimport java.util.Locale;\n\npublic class UnicodeComparison {\n\n    public static boolean isEqualNormalized(String str1, String str2) {\n        String normalizedStr1 = Normalizer.normalize(str1, Normalizer.Form.NFC);\n        String normalizedStr2 = Normalizer.normalize(str2, Normalizer.Form.NFC);\n        return normalizedStr1.equalsIgnoreCase(normalizedStr2);\n    }\n\n    public static void main(String[] args) {\n        String user = \"exampleUser\";\n        if (isEqualNormalized(JWTSecretKeyEndpoint.WEBGOAT_USER, user)) {\n            // Proceed with authenticated actions\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\n\n### Library Dependencies\n\nTo execute the code example properly, ensure the following library dependencies are included:\n\n- Java Development Kit (JDK) 1.6 or higher (for `java.text.Normalizer` and `java.util.Locale`).\n\n### OWASP Resources\n\n\n### Common Weakness Enumeration (CWE)\n\n- [CWE-176: Improper Handling of Unicode Encoding](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/176.html)"

                "markdown": "## Description\n\nPredictable pseudorandom number generator vulnerability in Java occurs when a pseudorandom number generator (PRNG) is used in a way that makes it easy for an attacker to predict future outputs. PRNGs are algorithms that use mathematical formulas to produce sequences of random numbers. However, these sequences are deterministic and will repeat after a certain period. If an attacker can predict the sequence, they can use this information to compromise the security of the application.\n\n## Mitigation Advice\n\nTo mitigate this vulnerability, it is recommended to use a secure random number generator. In Java, you can use the `java.security.SecureRandom` class, which provides a cryptographically strong random number generator (RNG). \n\n## Source Code Fix Recommendation\n\nHere is an example of how to use `SecureRandom` in Java:\n\n```java\nimport java.security.SecureRandom;\n\npublic class SecureRandomDemo {\n    public static void main(String[] args) {\n        SecureRandom secureRandom = new SecureRandom();\n        int randomInt = secureRandom.nextInt();\n        System.out.println(\"Secure random integer: \" + randomInt);\n    }\n}\n```\n\nIn this code, `SecureRandom` is used to generate a secure random integer. This is much more secure than using `java.util.Random` or `Math.random()`, which are predictable and not suitable for generating security-sensitive random numbers.\n\n## OWASP Resources\n\nFor more information on this vulnerability, you can refer to the following OWASP resources:\n\n- [OWASP Top 10 2017 Category A6 - Security Misconfiguration](https://owasp.org/www-project-top-ten/2017/A6_2017-Security_Misconfiguration)\n- [OWASP Cheat Sheet Series - Random Number Generation](https://cheatsheetseries.owasp.org/cheatsheets/Random_Number_Generation_Cheat_Sheet.html)\n\n## Common Weakness Enumeration (CWE)\n\nThis vulnerability is related to:\n\n- [CWE-330: Use of Insufficiently Random Values](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/330.html)\n- [CWE-338: Use of Cryptographically Weak PRNG](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/338.html)"

The `@Size` annotation is used to ensure that the length of the parameter value is between 1 and 5 characters long.\n\nTo run this application, you will need the following dependencies:\n\n```xml\n<dependencies>\n    <dependency>\n        <groupId>javax.validation</groupId>\n        <artifactId>validation-api</artifactId>\n        <version>2.0.1.Final</version>\n    </dependency>\n    <dependency>\n        <groupId>org.hibernate</groupId>\n        <artifactId>hibernate-validator</artifactId>\n        <version>6.0.13.Final</version>\n    </dependency>\n</dependencies>\n```\n\nThe `validation-api` dependency provides the Java Bean Validation API, and the `hibernate-validator` dependency provides the implementation of this API.\n\nPlease note that this is a simple example and does not include the full application code. You would typically use the `UserProfile` class as part of a larger application, and the validation would be triggered when you attempt to persist an instance of this class or when you manually trigger the validation process.\n\n#### Option II\n\nHere is a simple Java console application that validates the \"size\" parameter using a regular expression pattern. This application uses the java.util.regex package for pattern matching.\n\n```java\nimport java.util.Scanner;\nimport java.util.regex.Pattern;\n\npublic class Main {\n    public static void main(String[] args) {\n        Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);\n        System.out.println(\"Enter size:\");\n        String size = scanner.nextLine();\n        if (isValidSize(size)) {\n            System.out.println(\"Size is valid\");\n        } else {\n            System.out.println(\"Size is invalid\");\n        }\n    }\n\n    public static boolean isValidSize(String size) {\n        String pattern = \"^[0-9]{1,5}$\";\n        return Pattern.matches(pattern, size);\n    }\n}\n```\n\nThis application prompts the user to enter a size, then checks if the entered size is valid. The size is considered valid if it matches the regular expression pattern \"^[0-9]{1,5}$\", which means it must be a number between 1 and 5 characters long.\n\nTo run this application, you need the following dependencies:\n\n- Java Development Kit (JDK) 8 or later\n- A Java IDE or a text editor\n\nTo run the application:\n\n1. Copy the code into a new Java class in your IDE or text editor.\n2. Compile the Java class.\n3. Run the compiled class.\n\nThe application will prompt you to enter a size. After you enter a size, it will tell you whether the size is valid or not.\n\n\n\n## References\n- [OWASP: REST Security Cheat Sheet](https://cheatsheetseries.owasp.org/cheatsheets/REST_Security_Cheat_Sheet.html)\n- [OWASP: Input Validation Cheat Sheet](https://cheatsheetseries.owasp.org/cheatsheets/Input_Validation_Cheat_Sheet.html)\n- [OWASP: Bean Validation Cheat Sheet](https://cheatsheetseries.owasp.org/cheatsheets/Bean_Validation_Cheat_Sheet.html)\n\n\n"

It then calls the `validateToken` method to check if the token matches the provided regex pattern and if its length is between 32 and 1000 characters. \n\nThe `validateToken` method uses the `Pattern.matches` method from the `java.util.regex` package to check if the token matches the regex pattern. It also checks the length of the token using the `length` method of the `String` class.\n\nThis application does not require any additional dependencies and can be run using any Java 8+ environment. \n\nTo run this application, you can simply compile the `Main.java` file and run the `Main` class. For example, if you are using the command line, you can use the following commands:\n\n```bash\njavac Main.java\njava Main\n```\n\nThen, you can enter the JWT token when prompted. The application will print \"Token is valid\" if the token is valid, and \"Token is invalid\" otherwise.\n\n\n\n## References\n- [OWASP: REST Security Cheat Sheet](https://cheatsheetseries.owasp.org/cheatsheets/REST_Security_Cheat_Sheet.html)\n- [OWASP: Input Validation Cheat Sheet](https://cheatsheetseries.owasp.org/cheatsheets/Input_Validation_Cheat_Sheet.html)\n- [OWASP: Bean Validation Cheat Sheet](https://cheatsheetseries.owasp.org/cheatsheets/Bean_Validation_Cheat_Sheet.html)\n\n\n"

Also, the `ValidationService` is a simple utility class, you might want to make it a Spring `@Service` and inject it where needed.\n\n\n\n## References\n- [OWASP: REST Security Cheat Sheet](https://cheatsheetseries.owasp.org/cheatsheets/REST_Security_Cheat_Sheet.html)\n- [OWASP: Input Validation Cheat Sheet](https://cheatsheetseries.owasp.org/cheatsheets/Input_Validation_Cheat_Sheet.html)\n- [OWASP: Bean Validation Cheat Sheet](https://cheatsheetseries.owasp.org/cheatsheets/Bean_Validation_Cheat_Sheet.html)\n\n\n"

The regex pattern allows for a minimum of 3 characters, while the requirement states a minimum of 1 character. The regex pattern used in the example above follows the requirement of 1 to 4 characters. If you want to follow the regex pattern, you should replace \"{1,4}\" with \"{3,}\" in the pattern string.\n\n\n\n## References\n- [OWASP: REST Security Cheat Sheet](https://cheatsheetseries.owasp.org/cheatsheets/REST_Security_Cheat_Sheet.html)\n- [OWASP: Input Validation Cheat Sheet](https://cheatsheetseries.owasp.org/cheatsheets/Input_Validation_Cheat_Sheet.html)\n- [OWASP: Bean Validation Cheat Sheet](https://cheatsheetseries.owasp.org/cheatsheets/Bean_Validation_Cheat_Sheet.html)\n\n\n"

In Java, using the `equals()` method for hash comparison can lead to security vulnerabilities because it may allow attackers to deduce information about the hash values based on the time it takes to perform the comparison. This is particularly problematic when comparing sensitive data such as passwords or cryptographic keys.\n\n### General Mitigation Advice\n\nTo mitigate this vulnerability, use a constant-time comparison method to compare hash values. This approach ensures that the comparison takes the same amount of time regardless of the input values, thus preventing timing attacks.\n\n### Source Code Fix Recommendation\n\nReplace the insecure `equals()` method with a constant-time comparison method. Java's `MessageDigest.isEqual()` method can be used for this purpose.\n\n```java\nimport java.security.MessageDigest;\nimport java.util.Arrays;\n\npublic class SecureHashComparison {\n\n    private byte[] userHash;\n\n    public SecureHashComparison(byte[] userHash) {\n        this.userHash = userHash;\n    }\n\n    public boolean isHashEqual(byte[] inputHash) {\n        return MessageDigest.isEqual(this.userHash, inputHash);\n    }\n\n    public static void main(String[] args) {\n        byte[] storedHash = {/* some hash value */};\n        byte[] inputHash = {/* hash to compare */};\n\n        SecureHashComparison displayUser = new SecureHashComparison(storedHash);\n\n        if (displayUser.isHashEqual(inputHash)) {\n            System.out.println(\"Hashes match!\");\n        } else {\n            System.out.println(\"Hashes do not match.\");\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\n\n### Library Dependencies\n\nThe above code example requires the following library dependencies to execute properly:\n\n- Java Development Kit (JDK) 1.5 or later (for `java.security.MessageDigest` and `java.util.Arrays`).\n\n### Relevant OWASP Resources\n\n- [OWASP Top Ten](https://owasp.org/www-project-top-ten/)\n- [OWASP Cryptographic Storage Cheat Sheet](https://cheatsheetseries.owasp.org/cheatsheets/Cryptographic_Storage_Cheat_Sheet.html)\n\n### Common Weakness Enumeration (CWE)\n\n- [CWE-203: Observable Discrepancy](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/203.html)\n- [CWE-208: Observable Timing Discrepancy](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/208.html)"

You can compile the application with the `javac` command and run it with the `java` command. For example:\n\n```\njavac PasswordValidation.java\njava PasswordValidation\n```\n\nPlease note that the provided regex pattern and the requirement \"Length of the parameter value must be between 8 and 8 characters long\" are contradictory. The regex pattern allows passwords of 8 or more characters, while the requirement allows only passwords of exactly 8 characters. The code above follows the regex pattern. If you want to enforce a length of exactly 8 characters, you can change the `{8,}` in the regex pattern to `{8}`.\n\n\n\n## References\n- [OWASP: REST Security Cheat Sheet](https://cheatsheetseries.owasp.org/cheatsheets/REST_Security_Cheat_Sheet.html)\n- [OWASP: Input Validation Cheat Sheet](https://cheatsheetseries.owasp.org/cheatsheets/Input_Validation_Cheat_Sheet.html)\n- [OWASP: Bean Validation Cheat Sheet](https://cheatsheetseries.owasp.org/cheatsheets/Bean_Validation_Cheat_Sheet.html)\n\n\n"

In Java, using the `equals()` method for hash comparison can lead to security vulnerabilities because it may allow attackers to deduce information about the hash values based on the time it takes to perform the comparison. This is particularly problematic when comparing sensitive data such as passwords or cryptographic keys.\n\n### General Mitigation Advice\n\nTo mitigate this vulnerability, use a constant-time comparison method to compare hash values. This approach ensures that the comparison takes the same amount of time regardless of the input values, thus preventing timing attacks.\n\n### Source Code Fix Recommendation\n\nReplace the insecure `equals()` method with a constant-time comparison method. Java's `MessageDigest.isEqual()` method can be used for this purpose.\n\n```java\nimport java.security.MessageDigest;\nimport java.util.Arrays;\n\npublic class SecureHashComparison {\n\n    private byte[] userHash;\n\n    public SecureHashComparison(byte[] userHash) {\n        this.userHash = userHash;\n    }\n\n    public boolean isHashEqual(byte[] inputHash) {\n        return MessageDigest.isEqual(this.userHash, inputHash);\n    }\n\n    public static void main(String[] args) {\n        byte[] storedHash = {/* some hash value */};\n        byte[] inputHash = {/* hash to compare */};\n\n        SecureHashComparison displayUser = new SecureHashComparison(storedHash);\n\n        if (displayUser.isHashEqual(inputHash)) {\n            System.out.println(\"Hashes match!\");\n        } else {\n            System.out.println(\"Hashes do not match.\");\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\n\n### Library Dependencies\n\nThe above code example requires the following library dependencies to execute properly:\n\n- Java Development Kit (JDK) 1.5 or later (for `java.security.MessageDigest` and `java.util.Arrays`).\n\n### Relevant OWASP Resources\n\n- [OWASP Top Ten](https://owasp.org/www-project-top-ten/)\n- [OWASP Cryptographic Storage Cheat Sheet](https://cheatsheetseries.owasp.org/cheatsheets/Cryptographic_Storage_Cheat_Sheet.html)\n\n### Common Weakness Enumeration (CWE)\n\n- [CWE-203: Observable Discrepancy](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/203.html)\n- [CWE-208: Observable Timing Discrepancy](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/208.html)"

If you want it to be exactly 8 characters long, you should change both to 8.\n\n#### Option II\n\nHere is a simple Java console application that validates a password using the provided regex pattern. This application uses Java's built-in `Pattern` and `Matcher` classes from `java.util.regex` package.\n\n```java\nimport java.util.regex.Matcher;\nimport java.util.regex.Pattern;\nimport java.util.Scanner;\n\npublic class Main {\n    public static void main(String[] args) {\n        Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);\n        System.out.println(\"Enter your password:\");\n        String password = scanner.nextLine();\n        if (isValidPassword(password)) {\n            System.out.println(\"Password is valid.\");\n        } else {\n            System.out.println(\"Password is invalid.\");\n        }\n        scanner.close();\n    }\n\n    public static boolean isValidPassword(String password) {\n        String regex = \"^(?=.*[0-9])(?=.*[a-z])(?=.*[A-Z])(?=.*[@#$%^&+=]).{8,20}$\";\n        Pattern pattern = Pattern.compile(regex);\n        Matcher matcher = pattern.matcher(password);\n        return matcher.matches();\n    }\n}\n```\n\nThis application prompts the user to enter a password, then checks if the password is valid using the `isValidPassword` method. The `isValidPassword` method uses the provided regex pattern to check if the password contains at least one digit, one lowercase letter, one uppercase letter, one special character, and is between 8 and 20 characters long.\n\nDependencies:\n- Java Development Kit (JDK) 8 or later\n\nTo run this application, you need to have JDK installed on your machine. You can compile the application using the `javac` command and run it using the `java` command.\n\nPlease note that the requirement \"Length of the parameter value must be between 8 and 8 characters long\" seems to be a typo, as it contradicts the regex pattern provided. The regex pattern specifies that the password should be between 8 and 20 characters long. The `isValidPassword` method in the provided code follows the regex pattern. If you want the password to be exactly 8 characters long, you can modify the regex pattern to `.{8}$`.\n\n\n\n## References\n- [OWASP: REST Security Cheat Sheet](https://cheatsheetseries.owasp.org/cheatsheets/REST_Security_Cheat_Sheet.html)\n- [OWASP: Input Validation Cheat Sheet](https://cheatsheetseries.owasp.org/cheatsheets/Input_Validation_Cheat_Sheet.html)\n- [OWASP: Bean Validation Cheat Sheet](https://cheatsheetseries.owasp.org/cheatsheets/Bean_Validation_Cheat_Sheet.html)\n\n\n"

                "markdown": "## Description\n\n\"Password Embedded in Code\" is a security vulnerability that occurs when sensitive data, such as passwords, are hard-coded directly into the source code. This is a bad practice because it exposes the sensitive data to anyone who has access to the source code. It also makes the system vulnerable to attacks if the source code is ever leaked or decompiled. This vulnerability is particularly prevalent in Java programming language due to its wide usage and the ease of decompiling Java bytecode.\n\n## Mitigation Advice\n\nTo mitigate this vulnerability, avoid hard-coding sensitive data directly into the source code. Instead, use secure methods to store and retrieve sensitive data, such as:\n\n- Environment variables: These are a good place to store sensitive data because they are not part of the source code and can be set per environment.\n- Configuration files: These can be used to store sensitive data, but they should be properly secured and not included in the version control system.\n- Secure storage solutions: These are services specifically designed to store sensitive data securely. Examples include AWS Secrets Manager, Azure Key Vault, and HashiCorp Vault.\n\n## Source Code Fix Recommendation\n\nInstead of hard-coding the password directly into the source code, retrieve it from a secure source at runtime. Here is an example of how to do this using environment variables:\n\n```java\nString passwordTom = System.getenv(\"PASSWORD_TOM_9\");\nif (passwordTom.equals(userInput))\n```\n\nIn this example, `PASSWORD_TOM_9` is an environment variable that contains the password. The password is retrieved at runtime and is not included in the source code.\n\n## Library Dependencies\n\nThe code example does not require any additional library dependencies to execute properly.\n\n## References\n\n- [OWASP Top 10 2017 Category A3 - Sensitive Data Exposure](https://owasp.org/www-project-top-ten/2017/A3_2017-Sensitive_Data_Exposure)\n- [OWASP Java Encoder Project](https://owasp.org/www-project-java-encoder/)\n- [CWE-798: Use of Hard-coded Credentials](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/798.html)"

This example uses the Apache Commons IO library to handle file operations.\n\n```java\nimport org.apache.commons.io.FilenameUtils;\nimport java.io.File;\nimport java.io.IOException;\n\npublic class Main {\n    public static void main(String[] args) {\n        String uploadDirectory = \"/home/user/uploads/\";\n        String fullName = \"../etc/passwd\"; // This is a potentially dangerous input\n\n        try {\n            File file = new File(uploadDirectory, fullName);\n            String canonicalPath = file.getCanonicalPath();\n\n            if (!canonicalPath.startsWith(FilenameUtils.separatorsToSystem(uploadDirectory))) {\n                System.out.println(\"Potential path traversal attack detected!\");\n            } else {\n                System.out.println(\"File is within the intended directory.\");\n            }\n        } catch (IOException e) {\n            e.printStackTrace();\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\n\nThis program will print \"Potential path traversal attack detected!\" if the canonicalized file path does not start with the intended upload directory. This is because the `../` in the `fullName` variable would cause the file to be located outside of the intended directory.\n\nTo run this program, you will need the following dependencies:\n\n- Java Development Kit (JDK) 8 or later\n- Apache Commons IO library\n\nYou can add the Apache Commons IO library to your project using Maven by adding the following to your `pom.xml` file:\n\n```xml\n<dependencies>\n    <dependency>\n        <groupId>commons-io</groupId>\n        <artifactId>commons-io</artifactId>\n        <version>2.8.0</version>\n    </dependency>\n</dependencies>\n```\n\nOr, if you're using Gradle, add this to your `build.gradle` file:\n\n```groovy\ndependencies {\n    implementation 'commons-io:commons-io:2.8.0'\n}\n```\n\nRemember to always validate and sanitize user input, especially when dealing with file paths.\n\n\n\n## References\n- [OWASP: Path Traversal](https://owasp.org/www-community/attacks/Path_Traversal)\n- [OWASP: Input Validation Cheat Sheet](https://cheatsheetseries.owasp.org/cheatsheets/Input_Validation_Cheat_Sheet.html)\n- [CWE-22: Improper Limitation of a Pathname to a Restricted Directory ('Path Traversal')](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/22.html)\n\n\n"

This can lead to various security issues such as arbitrary file creation, deletion, or modification.\n\nThe null byte is a powerful character in file operations. When the Java Runtime Environment (JRE) passes a filename to the underlying operating system, if the filename contains a null byte, the operating system will recognize only the part of the filename before the null byte. This can lead to unexpected behavior and potential security vulnerabilities.\n\n## Mitigation Advice\n\nTo mitigate this vulnerability, you should always validate and sanitize all user inputs, especially filenames. Never trust user inputs blindly. Make sure to remove or replace null bytes and other special characters in filenames.\n\nIn addition, consider using a secure coding library or framework that automatically handles these types of issues. Also, keep your libraries and frameworks up-to-date to benefit from the latest security fixes.\n\n## Source Code Fix Recommendation\n\nHere is a simple way to remove null bytes from a filename in Java:\n\n```java\nString filename = /* the filename from user input */;\nfilename = filename.replace(\"\\0\", \"\");\n```\n\nThis will replace all null bytes in the filename with nothing, effectively removing them.\n\n## References\n\n- [OWASP Null Byte Injection](https://owasp.org/www-community/vulnerabilities/Null_byte_injection)\n- [OWASP Input Validation Cheat Sheet](https://cheatsheetseries.owasp.org/cheatsheets/Input_Validation_Cheat_Sheet.html)\n\n## Matching CWE\n\n- [CWE-158: Improper Neutralization of Null Byte or NUL Character](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/158.html)"

This vulnerability can occur when a program does not correctly convert Unicode or non-Unicode characters to their proper format. This can lead to a situation where an attacker can bypass security checks or cause the application to behave unexpectedly.\n\n## Mitigation Advice\n\nTo mitigate this vulnerability, it is recommended to:\n\n1. Always validate and sanitize user input to ensure it is in the expected format.\n2. Use libraries and functions that support Unicode transformations correctly.\n3. Regularly update and patch your software to fix any known vulnerabilities.\n4. Use a security-focused development lifecycle that includes security training, threat modeling, code review, and security testing.\n\n## Source Code Fix Recommendation\n\nThe specific vulnerability sink in the provided code is the use of the `equalsIgnoreCase` method. This method does not properly handle Unicode transformations, which can lead to security issues. A recommended fix would be to use a method that correctly handles Unicode transformations, such as `MessageDigest.isEqual`.\n\nHere is a fixed version of the code:\n\n```java\nimport java.security.MessageDigest;\nimport java.nio.charset.StandardCharsets;\n\n// ...\n\nbyte[] hashedUsername = MessageDigest.getInstance(\"SHA-512\").digest(getWebSession().getUserName().getBytes(StandardCharsets.UTF_8));\nbyte[] secretBytes = secret.getBytes(StandardCharsets.UTF_8);\n\nif (MessageDigest.isEqual(hashedUsername, secretBytes)) {\n    // ...\n}\n```\n\n## Library Dependencies\n\nThe code example requires the following library dependencies:\n\n- Java Cryptography Extension (JCE)\n- Java Standard Edition (SE) libraries\n\n## OWASP and CWE Links\n\n- [OWASP - Unicode Transformation Issues](https://cheatsheetseries.owasp.org/cheatsheets/Unicode_Transformation_Issues_Cheat_Sheet.html)\n- [CWE-176: Improper Handling of Unicode Encoding](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/176.html)"

This example uses the Apache Commons IO library to handle the file path manipulation.\n\n```java\nimport org.apache.commons.io.FilenameUtils;\nimport java.io.File;\nimport java.io.IOException;\n\npublic class FilePathCanonicalization {\n\n    public static void main(String[] args) {\n        String userDefinedPath = \"<empty>\"; // This should be replaced with the actual user input\n        String intendedDirectory = \"/path/to/intended/directory\"; // This should be replaced with the actual intended directory\n\n        try {\n            String canonicalPath = new File(userDefinedPath).getCanonicalPath();\n            String canonicalIntendedDirectory = new File(intendedDirectory).getCanonicalPath();\n\n            if (FilenameUtils.directoryContains(canonicalIntendedDirectory, canonicalPath)) {\n                System.out.println(\"The file resides within the intended directory.\");\n            } else {\n                System.out.println(\"The file does not reside within the intended directory.\");\n            }\n        } catch (IOException e) {\n            System.out.println(\"An error occurred while canonicalizing the file path.\");\n            e.printStackTrace();\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\n\nThis console application takes a user-defined file path and an intended directory, canonicalizes both paths, and then checks if the file resides within the intended directory. If the file does reside within the intended directory, it prints a message saying so. If the file does not reside within the intended directory, it prints a different message. If an error occurs while canonicalizing the file paths, it prints an error message and the stack trace of the exception.\n\nThe only dependency needed to run this application is the Apache Commons IO library. You can add it to your project using Maven by adding the following to your `pom.xml` file:\n\n```xml\n<dependencies>\n    <dependency>\n        <groupId>commons-io</groupId>\n        <artifactId>commons-io</artifactId>\n        <version>2.8.0</version>\n    </dependency>\n</dependencies>\n```\n\nOr, if you're using Gradle, add the following to your `build.gradle` file:\n\n```gradle\ndependencies {\n    implementation 'commons-io:commons-io:2.8.0'\n}\n```\n\nPlease note that you should replace the version number with the latest version of the library.\n\n\n\n## References\n- [OWASP: Path Traversal](https://owasp.org/www-community/attacks/Path_Traversal)\n- [OWASP: Input Validation Cheat Sheet](https://cheatsheetseries.owasp.org/cheatsheets/Input_Validation_Cheat_Sheet.html)\n- [CWE-22: Improper Limitation of a Pathname to a Restricted Directory ('Path Traversal')](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/22.html)\n\n\n"

If the password length is controlled by an attacker, it could potentially contain malicious XML code that could lead to an XML Injection attack.\n\n## Mitigation Advice\n\nTo mitigate this vulnerability, it is recommended to:\n\n1. Use XML encoding before appending the password length to the XML string. This will ensure that any special characters in the password length are properly encoded and will not be interpreted as XML code by the XML parser.\n\n2. Use parameterized queries or prepared statements to prevent XML Injection attacks. These techniques ensure that the parameters are properly escaped and are not interpreted as part of the XML code.\n\n3.

This can lead to various security issues such as information disclosure, data corruption, and denial of service.\n\nIn the provided code snippet, the vulnerability arises from the use of the `toLowerCase()` method. This method is locale-sensitive and can produce unexpected results when dealing with Unicode characters. For example, the German sharp S (ß) is transformed to \"ss\" in lower case, which can lead to incorrect results if not properly handled.\n\n## Mitigation Advice\n\nTo mitigate this vulnerability, you should use locale-insensitive methods for case transformations. In Java, you can use the `toLowerCase(Locale.ROOT)` method to ensure that the transformation is not affected by the current locale.\n\n## Source Code Fix Recommendation\n\nHere is the recommended fix for the provided code snippet:\n\n```java\nimport java.util.Locale;\n\n// ...\n\ncookieUsername = EncDec.decode(cookieValue).toLowerCase(Locale.ROOT);\n```\n\n## Library Dependencies\n\nThe provided code snippet does not specify any library dependencies.

However, if you want to connect to a MySQL database, you need to add the MySQL Connector/J library to your project. Here is the Maven dependency that should be added to your `pom.xml`:\n\n```xml\n<dependency>\n    <groupId>mysql</groupId>\n    <artifactId>mysql-connector-java</artifactId>\n    <version>8.0.23</version>\n</dependency>\n```\n\nTo add this dependency to your `pom.xml` file, you need to paste it inside the `<dependencies>` tag. Maven will automatically download and add this library to your project.\n\nAlternative JDBC providers that could be used are PostgreSQL JDBC Driver for PostgreSQL databases, Microsoft JDBC Driver for SQL Server for Microsoft SQL Server databases, and Oracle JDBC driver for Oracle databases. Each of these providers has its own Maven dependency that should be added to the `pom.xml` file.\n\n\n\n**References (SQL injection)**\n\n- [CAPEC-66: SQL Injection](https://capec.mitre.org/data/definitions/66.html)\n- [CWE-89: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an SQL Command ('SQL Injection')](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/89.html)\n- [OWASP: Top 10 A03_2021-Injection](https://owasp.org/Top10/A03_2021-Injection/)\n- [OWASP: SQL Injection Prevention Cheat Sheet](https://www.owasp.org/index.php/SQL_Injection_Prevention_Cheat_Sheet)\n- [OWASP: Query Parameterization Cheat Sheet](https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Query_Parameterization_Cheat_Sheet)\n\n\n"

You can run this application in any Java environment that supports Java 8 or later.\n\nPlease note that the provided regex pattern allows passwords of length 8 to 20 characters, but the requirement specifies that the password should be between 8 and 11 characters long. The `validatePassword` method in the above code takes this into account and checks the length of the password after matching the regex pattern. If the password is longer than 11 characters, the method returns `false`.\n\nAlso, remember that this is a simple console application for demonstration purposes. In a real-world application, you would typically not print the password to the console, and you would handle the password in a secure manner to protect it from being exposed.\n\n\n\n## References\n- [OWASP: REST Security Cheat Sheet](https://cheatsheetseries.owasp.org/cheatsheets/REST_Security_Cheat_Sheet.html)\n- [OWASP: Input Validation Cheat Sheet](https://cheatsheetseries.owasp.org/cheatsheets/Input_Validation_Cheat_Sheet.html)\n- [OWASP: Bean Validation Cheat Sheet](https://cheatsheetseries.owasp.org/cheatsheets/Bean_Validation_Cheat_Sheet.html)\n\n\n"

The `?` is a placeholder that will be replaced by the value of `username_reg` in a safe way that prevents SQL Injection.\n\nThe necessary libraries for this example are `mysql-connector-java` for MySQL JDBC driver. Here is the record that should be added to `pom.xml`:\n\n```xml\n<dependencies>\n    <dependency>\n        <groupId>mysql</groupId>\n        <artifactId>mysql-connector-java</artifactId>\n        <version>8.0.23</version>\n    </dependency>\n</dependencies>\n```\n\nTo add this to your `pom.xml` file, you simply need to copy the above XML snippet and paste it into the `<dependencies>` section of your `pom.xml` file.\n\nAlternative JDBC providers that could be used are PostgreSQL JDBC Driver (`org.postgresql:postgresql`), Microsoft JDBC Driver for SQL Server (`com.microsoft.sqlserver:mssql-jdbc`), and Oracle JDBC driver (`com.oracle.database.jdbc:ojdbc8`).

This can help to identify issues that may be missed during manual code reviews.\"\n## In Context Remediation\n```\nVulnerable code: sqle.printStackTrace()\n```\nHere is an example of how to handle exceptions securely in Java. In this example, we are using the `java.util.logging` package to log errors and `java.sql` package for SQL related operations.\n\n```java\nimport java.sql.Connection;\nimport java.sql.DriverManager;\nimport java.sql.SQLException;\nimport java.util.logging.Level;\nimport java.util.logging.Logger;\n\npublic class SecureErrorHandlingExample {\n    private static final Logger LOGGER = Logger.getLogger(SecureErrorHandlingExample.class.getName());\n\n    public String getPassword() {\n        String password = null;\n        try {\n            Connection connection = DriverManager.getConnection(\"jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/mydb\", \"user\", \"password\");\n            // Assume some SQL operation here that might throw SQLException\n        } catch (SQLException sqle) {\n            LOGGER.log(Level.SEVERE, \"An error occurred while fetching the password\", sqle);\n            return \"An error occurred.

This way, the error details are not exposed to the user, but they are still available in the logs for debugging purposes. The user is shown a generic error message that does not reveal any internal details.\n\nThis approach mitigates potential security issues by preventing information leakage. By not revealing the internal details of the error to the user, we are making it harder for an attacker to gain information about the system that could be used in an attack. At the same time, by logging the error details, we are ensuring that we have the information we need to debug and fix the issue.\n\n\n## References\n- [OWASP: Improper Error Handling](https://owasp.org/www-community/Improper_Error_Handling)\n- [OWASP: Error Handling Cheat Sheet](https://cheatsheetseries.owasp.org/cheatsheets/Error_Handling_Cheat_Sheet.html)\n- [CWE-209: Generation of Error Message Containing Sensitive Information](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/209.html)\n\n\n"

                "markdown": "\nImproper handling of errors can introduce a variety of security problems for a web site. The most common problem is when detailed internal error messages such as stack traces, database dumps, and error codes are displayed to the user (hacker). These messages reveal implementation details that should never be revealed. Such details can provide hackers important clues on potential flaws in the site and such messages are also disturbing to normal users.\n\n## Solution (Error Handling)\n\n1. \"Avoid using e.printStackTrace() as it may reveal sensitive information about the system. Instead, use a logging framework like Log4J or SLF4J to log errors.\"\n\n2. \"Ensure that error messages displayed to users are generic and do not reveal any details about the system's internal workings. This helps to prevent information leakage.\"\n\n3. \"Implement a centralized error handling mechanism to ensure consistency in logging and handling errors across the application.\"\n\n4. \"Use exception handling best practices, such as throwing only when an exceptional condition occurs, catching only when a specific action can be taken, and not ignoring exceptions.\"\n\n5. \"Consider using custom exceptions to provide more context about the error, making it easier to diagnose and fix.\"\n\n6. \"Regularly review and monitor your logs to identify any potential security threats or vulnerabilities.\"\n\n7. \"Ensure that your logging data is secure and cannot be tampered with by unauthorized users.\"\n\n8. \"Consider using a security framework like OWASP ESAPI which provides many security controls including secure error handling.\"\n\n9. \"Always sanitize and validate user inputs to prevent SQL injection attacks.\"\n\n10. \"Regularly update and patch your systems to protect against known vulnerabilities.\"\n## In Context Remediation\n```\nVulnerable code: e.printStackTrace()\n```\nHere is an example of how to handle exceptions securely in Java:\n\n```java\nimport java.util.logging.Level;\nimport java.util.logging.Logger;\n\npublic class SecureErrorHandlingExample {\n    private static final Logger LOGGER = Logger.getLogger(SecureErrorHandlingExample.class.getName());\n\n    public static void main(String[] args) {\n        try {\n            getPassword();\n        } catch (Exception e) {\n            LOGGER.log(Level.SEVERE, \"An error occurred while retrieving the password.\", e);\n            System.out.println(\"An error occurred. Please try again later.\");\n        }\n    }\n\n    protected static String getPassword() throws Exception {\n        throw new Exception(\"This is a simulated error.\");\n    }\n}\n```\n\nDependencies:\n- Java SE Development Kit 8 or later\n\nThis code mitigates potential security issues by not revealing the details of the exception to the user. Instead, it logs the exception details using Java's built-in logging framework, which can be configured to write logs to a secure location that is not accessible to potential attackers. The user is shown a generic error message that does not reveal any information about the internal workings of the application.\n\nThe `e.printStackTrace()` method is avoided because it writes the stack trace to the standard error stream, which may be visible to the user or other unauthorized individuals. This can reveal sensitive information about the application's internal structure, which can be used to plan further attacks.\n\nInstead, the `Logger.log()` method is used to record the details of the exception. This method can be configured to write logs to a variety of destinations, including the console, a file, or a network socket. The log level (in this case, `Level.SEVERE`) indicates the severity of the error, which can be useful for monitoring and troubleshooting.\n\nThe `System.out.println()` method is used to display a generic error message to the user. This message does not reveal any details about the error, which helps to maintain the security of the application.\n\n\n## References\n- [OWASP: Improper Error Handling](https://owasp.org/www-community/Improper_Error_Handling)\n- [OWASP: Error Handling Cheat Sheet](https://cheatsheetseries.owasp.org/cheatsheets/Error_Handling_Cheat_Sheet.html)\n- [CWE-209: Generation of Error Message Containing Sensitive Information](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/209.html)\n\n\n"

It will then validate the query using the provided regex pattern and print whether the query is valid or not. The query is considered valid if it only contains alphanumeric characters and underscores, and its length is between 1 and 5 characters.\n\n\n\n## References\n- [OWASP: REST Security Cheat Sheet](https://cheatsheetseries.owasp.org/cheatsheets/REST_Security_Cheat_Sheet.html)\n- [OWASP: Input Validation Cheat Sheet](https://cheatsheetseries.owasp.org/cheatsheets/Input_Validation_Cheat_Sheet.html)\n- [OWASP: Bean Validation Cheat Sheet](https://cheatsheetseries.owasp.org/cheatsheets/Bean_Validation_Cheat_Sheet.html)\n\n\n"

No additional dependencies are required. \n\nThis application takes a \"query\" string, checks if its length is between 1 and 5 characters, and then checks if it matches the regex pattern \"^[a-zA-Z0-9_]+$\". If both conditions are met, the method returns true; otherwise, it returns false. \n\nPlease note that this is a simple console application for demonstration purposes. In a real-world application, you would likely get the \"query\" string from a user input field, and you might handle invalid inputs differently (for example, by throwing an exception or returning a detailed error message).\n\n\n\n## References\n- [OWASP: REST Security Cheat Sheet](https://cheatsheetseries.owasp.org/cheatsheets/REST_Security_Cheat_Sheet.html)\n- [OWASP: Input Validation Cheat Sheet](https://cheatsheetseries.owasp.org/cheatsheets/Input_Validation_Cheat_Sheet.html)\n- [OWASP: Bean Validation Cheat Sheet](https://cheatsheetseries.owasp.org/cheatsheets/Bean_Validation_Cheat_Sheet.html)\n\n\n"

The `?` is a placeholder that will be replaced by the value provided by `setString()` method. This way, the `action` value is properly escaped by the JDBC driver, preventing any SQL Injection.\n\nThe necessary libraries for this example are:\n\n```xml\n<dependencies>\n    <dependency>\n        <groupId>mysql</groupId>\n        <artifactId>mysql-connector-java</artifactId>\n        <version>8.0.23</version>\n    </dependency>\n</dependencies>\n```\n\nThis dependency is for the MySQL JDBC driver, which is used to connect to a MySQL database. To add it to your `pom.xml` file, you just need to copy and paste the above XML code inside the `<dependencies>` tag of your `pom.xml` file.\n\nAlternative JDBC providers that could be used are PostgreSQL's JDBC driver (`org.postgresql:postgresql`), Microsoft's SQL Server JDBC driver (`com.microsoft.sqlserver:mssql-jdbc`), or Oracle's JDBC driver (`com.oracle.database.jdbc:ojdbc8`). The usage is similar, you just need to change the connection URL and possibly the username and password.\n\n\n\n**References (SQL injection)**\n\n- [CAPEC-66: SQL Injection](https://capec.mitre.org/data/definitions/66.html)\n- [CWE-89: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an SQL Command ('SQL Injection')](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/89.html)\n- [OWASP: Top 10 A03_2021-Injection](https://owasp.org/Top10/A03_2021-Injection/)\n- [OWASP: SQL Injection Prevention Cheat Sheet](https://www.owasp.org/index.php/SQL_Injection_Prevention_Cheat_Sheet)\n- [OWASP: Query Parameterization Cheat Sheet](https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Query_Parameterization_Cheat_Sheet)\n\n\n"

The `?` is a placeholder that we replace with the actual value using the `setString` method. This ensures that the value is properly escaped, preventing SQL Injection.\n\nHere is the Maven dependency for MySQL JDBC driver that should be added to your `pom.xml`:\n\n```xml\n<dependency>\n    <groupId>mysql</groupId>\n    <artifactId>mysql-connector-java</artifactId>\n    <version>8.0.22</version>\n</dependency>\n```\n\nTo add this to your `pom.xml`, you simply need to paste it inside the `<dependencies>` tag. Maven will automatically download and add the library to your project.\n\nAlternative JDBC providers that could be used are PostgreSQL JDBC Driver (`org.postgresql:postgresql`), Microsoft JDBC Driver for SQL Server (`com.microsoft.sqlserver:mssql-jdbc`), and Oracle JDBC driver (`com.oracle.database.jdbc:ojdbc8`). The process of adding these to your `pom.xml` is the same as for the MySQL JDBC driver.\n\n\n\n**References (SQL injection)**\n\n- [CAPEC-66: SQL Injection](https://capec.mitre.org/data/definitions/66.html)\n- [CWE-89: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an SQL Command ('SQL Injection')](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/89.html)\n- [OWASP: Top 10 A03_2021-Injection](https://owasp.org/Top10/A03_2021-Injection/)\n- [OWASP: SQL Injection Prevention Cheat Sheet](https://www.owasp.org/index.php/SQL_Injection_Prevention_Cheat_Sheet)\n- [OWASP: Query Parameterization Cheat Sheet](https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Query_Parameterization_Cheat_Sheet)\n\n\n"

This application uses the Spring Boot framework.\n\n```java\nimport org.springframework.boot.SpringApplication;\nimport org.springframework.boot.autoconfigure.SpringBootApplication;\nimport org.springframework.web.bind.annotation.PostMapping;\nimport org.springframework.web.bind.annotation.RequestParam;\nimport org.springframework.web.bind.annotation.RestController;\n\nimport java.util.regex.Pattern;\n\n@SpringBootApplication\npublic class AuthTanValidationApp {\n    public static void main(String[] args) {\n        SpringApplication.run(AuthTanValidationApp.class, args);\n    }\n}\n\n@RestController\nclass AuthTanValidationController {\n    private static final Pattern AUTH_TAN_PATTERN = Pattern.compile(\"^[a-zA-Z0-9]{6,8}$\");\n\n    @PostMapping(\"/validate\")\n    public String validateAuthTan(@RequestParam String auth_tan) {\n        if (AUTH_TAN_PATTERN.matcher(auth_tan).matches()) {\n            return \"Valid auth_tan\";\n        } else {\n            return \"Invalid auth_tan\";\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\n\nTo run this application, you need the following dependencies:\n\n- Spring Boot Starter Web\n- Spring Boot Starter Validation\n\nYou can add these dependencies to your Maven `pom.xml` file:\n\n```xml\n<dependencies>\n    <dependency>\n        <groupId>org.springframework.boot</groupId>\n        <artifactId>spring-boot-starter-web</artifactId>\n    </dependency>\n    <dependency>\n        <groupId>org.springframework.boot</groupId>\n        <artifactId>spring-boot-starter-validation</artifactId>\n    </dependency>\n</dependencies>\n```\n\nPlease note that the regex pattern you provided (\"^[a-zA-Z0-9]{10}$\") does not match the requirement of the auth_tan length being between 6 and 8 characters.

If the tag does not exist, you need to create it.\n\nAlternative JDBC providers that could be used are PostgreSQL's JDBC driver (org.postgresql:postgresql), Microsoft's JDBC driver for SQL Server (com.microsoft.sqlserver:mssql-jdbc), or Oracle's JDBC driver (com.oracle.database.jdbc:ojdbc8).\n\nRemember, the key to preventing SQL Injection is to never construct SQL queries using string concatenation of unchecked input data. Always use Prepared Statements, Parameterized Queries, or ORM frameworks to interact with the database.\n\n\n\n**References (SQL injection)**\n\n- [CAPEC-66: SQL Injection](https://capec.mitre.org/data/definitions/66.html)\n- [CWE-89: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an SQL Command ('SQL Injection')](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/89.html)\n- [OWASP: Top 10 A03_2021-Injection](https://owasp.org/Top10/A03_2021-Injection/)\n- [OWASP: SQL Injection Prevention Cheat Sheet](https://www.owasp.org/index.php/SQL_Injection_Prevention_Cheat_Sheet)\n- [OWASP: Query Parameterization Cheat Sheet](https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Query_Parameterization_Cheat_Sheet)\n\n\n"

It then validates this parameter using the `validateAuthTan` method. This method checks if the parameter matches the regex pattern and if its length is between 6 and 8 characters. If the parameter is valid, the application prints \"Auth_tan is valid.\" Otherwise, it prints \"Auth_tan is invalid.\"\n\n\n\n## References\n- [OWASP: REST Security Cheat Sheet](https://cheatsheetseries.owasp.org/cheatsheets/REST_Security_Cheat_Sheet.html)\n- [OWASP: Input Validation Cheat Sheet](https://cheatsheetseries.owasp.org/cheatsheets/Input_Validation_Cheat_Sheet.html)\n- [OWASP: Bean Validation Cheat Sheet](https://cheatsheetseries.owasp.org/cheatsheets/Bean_Validation_Cheat_Sheet.html)\n\n\n"

AND auth_tan = ?\";\n            PreparedStatement preparedStatement = connection.prepareStatement(query);\n            preparedStatement.setString(1, name);\n            preparedStatement.setString(2, auth_tan);\n            preparedStatement.executeQuery();\n        } catch (SQLException e) {\n            e.printStackTrace();\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\n\nIn the pom.xml file, you need to add the following dependency for the MySQL JDBC driver:\n\n```xml\n<dependencies>\n    <dependency>\n        <groupId>mysql</groupId>\n        <artifactId>mysql-connector-java</artifactId>\n        <version>8.0.23</version>\n    </dependency>\n</dependencies>\n```\n\nTo add this dependency, you need to open your pom.xml file and paste the above code inside the `<dependencies>` tag. If the `<dependencies>` tag does not exist, you need to create it.\n\nAlternative JDBC providers that could be used are PostgreSQL JDBC Driver (org.postgresql:postgresql), SQLite JDBC Driver (org.xerial:sqlite-jdbc), and Microsoft SQL Server JDBC Driver (com.microsoft.sqlserver:mssql-jdbc). To use these drivers, you need to replace the MySQL JDBC driver dependency in the pom.xml file with the corresponding dependency for the desired JDBC driver.\n\n\n\n**References (SQL injection)**\n\n- [CAPEC-66: SQL Injection](https://capec.mitre.org/data/definitions/66.html)\n- [CWE-89: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an SQL Command ('SQL Injection')](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/89.html)\n- [OWASP: Top 10 A03_2021-Injection](https://owasp.org/Top10/A03_2021-Injection/)\n- [OWASP: SQL Injection Prevention Cheat Sheet](https://www.owasp.org/index.php/SQL_Injection_Prevention_Cheat_Sheet)\n- [OWASP: Query Parameterization Cheat Sheet](https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Query_Parameterization_Cheat_Sheet)\n\n\n"

AND auth_tan = ?\";\n            PreparedStatement preparedStatement = connection.prepareStatement(query);\n            preparedStatement.setString(1, name);\n            preparedStatement.setString(2, auth_tan);\n            preparedStatement.executeQuery();\n        } catch (SQLException e) {\n            e.printStackTrace();\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\n\nIn the pom.xml file, you need to add the following dependency for the MySQL JDBC driver:\n\n```xml\n<dependencies>\n    <dependency>\n        <groupId>mysql</groupId>\n        <artifactId>mysql-connector-java</artifactId>\n        <version>8.0.23</version>\n    </dependency>\n</dependencies>\n```\n\nTo add this dependency, you need to open your pom.xml file and paste the above code inside the `<dependencies>` tag. If the `<dependencies>` tag does not exist, you need to create it.\n\nAlternative JDBC providers that could be used are PostgreSQL JDBC Driver (org.postgresql:postgresql), SQLite JDBC Driver (org.xerial:sqlite-jdbc), and Microsoft SQL Server JDBC Driver (com.microsoft.sqlserver:mssql-jdbc). To use these drivers, you need to replace the MySQL JDBC driver dependency in the pom.xml file with the corresponding dependency for the desired JDBC driver.\n\n\n\n**References (SQL injection)**\n\n- [CAPEC-66: SQL Injection](https://capec.mitre.org/data/definitions/66.html)\n- [CWE-89: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an SQL Command ('SQL Injection')](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/89.html)\n- [OWASP: Top 10 A03_2021-Injection](https://owasp.org/Top10/A03_2021-Injection/)\n- [OWASP: SQL Injection Prevention Cheat Sheet](https://www.owasp.org/index.php/SQL_Injection_Prevention_Cheat_Sheet)\n- [OWASP: Query Parameterization Cheat Sheet](https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Query_Parameterization_Cheat_Sheet)\n\n\n"

                "markdown": "\nImproper handling of errors can introduce a variety of security problems for a web site. The most common problem is when detailed internal error messages such as stack traces, database dumps, and error codes are displayed to the user (hacker). These messages reveal implementation details that should never be revealed. Such details can provide hackers important clues on potential flaws in the site and such messages are also disturbing to normal users.\n\n## Solution (Error Handling)\n\n1. \"Avoid using exception.printStackTrace() as it may reveal sensitive information about the system. Instead, use a logging framework like Log4J or SLF4J to log errors.\"\n\n2. \"Ensure that error messages displayed to the user are generic and do not reveal any details about the system's internal workings. This helps to prevent information leakage.\"\n\n3. \"Implement a centralized error handling mechanism to ensure consistent handling of errors throughout the application. This can help to prevent insecure error handling.\"\n\n4. \"Use try-catch blocks to handle exceptions and ensure that the program can recover from errors gracefully. This can help to prevent the program from crashing and revealing sensitive information.\"\n\n5. \"Always validate and sanitize input data to prevent SQL injection attacks. This can help to prevent malicious users from exploiting insecure error handling to gain unauthorized access to the system.\"\n\n6. \"Regularly review and update your error handling code to ensure that it is secure and up-to-date. This can help to prevent new vulnerabilities from being introduced into the system.\"\n\n7. \"Educate your development team about the importance of secure error handling and provide them with training on how to implement it correctly. This can help to ensure that all members of the team are aware of the risks associated with insecure error handling and know how to mitigate them.\"\n## In Context Remediation\n```\nVulnerable code: exception.printStackTrace()\n```\nHere is an example of how to properly handle exceptions in Java. In this example, we will use a logger to log the error details and return a user-friendly error message without revealing any internal details.\n\n```java\nimport java.util.logging.Level;\nimport java.util.logging.Logger;\n\npublic class SqlInjectionLesson10b {\n    private static final Logger LOGGER = Logger.getLogger(SqlInjectionLesson10b.class.getName());\n\n    private SimpleJavaFileObject getJavaFileContentsAsString(String s) {\n        try {\n            // Your code here\n        } catch (Exception e) {\n            LOGGER.log(Level.SEVERE, \"An error occurred while getting Java file contents\", e);\n            throw new RuntimeException(\"An error occurred. Please try again later.\");\n        }\n    }\n\n    public static void main(String[] args) {\n        SqlInjectionLesson10b lesson = new SqlInjectionLesson10b();\n        lesson.getJavaFileContentsAsString(\"test\");\n    }\n}\n```\n\nIn this code, we are using the `java.util.logging` package for logging errors. When an exception occurs, we log the error details using `LOGGER.log(Level.SEVERE, \"An error occurred while getting Java file contents\", e);`. This logs the error details in a secure location that can be reviewed by developers or security personnel to understand what went wrong.\n\nThen, we throw a new RuntimeException with a generic error message `throw new RuntimeException(\"An error occurred. Please try again later.\");`. This message does not reveal any internal details that could be exploited by an attacker, but it is still helpful to the user.\n\nThis approach mitigates potential security issues by ensuring that error details are not exposed to the user, which could provide valuable information to an attacker. Instead, these details are securely logged so that they can be reviewed and addressed by the appropriate personnel.\n\nDependencies needed to run this application:\n\n- Java Development Kit (JDK) 8 or above\n\nPlease note that the `SimpleJavaFileObject` and the method body for `getJavaFileContentsAsString` are not provided in this example, as they are not relevant to the error handling process.\n\n\n## References\n- [OWASP: Improper Error Handling](https://owasp.org/www-community/Improper_Error_Handling)\n- [OWASP: Error Handling Cheat Sheet](https://cheatsheetseries.owasp.org/cheatsheets/Error_Handling_Cheat_Sheet.html)\n- [CWE-209: Generation of Error Message Containing Sensitive Information](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/209.html)\n\n\n"

This method first checks if the length of the parameter is between 1 and 6 characters. If it is, it then checks if the parameter matches the regex pattern. If both conditions are met, the method returns `true`; otherwise, it returns `false`.\n\nDependencies:\n- Java Development Kit (JDK) 8 or later\n\nTo run this application, you need to have the JDK installed on your machine.

                "markdown": "\nImproper handling of errors can introduce a variety of security problems for a web site. The most common problem is when detailed internal error messages such as stack traces, database dumps, and error codes are displayed to the user (hacker). These messages reveal implementation details that should never be revealed. Such details can provide hackers important clues on potential flaws in the site and such messages are also disturbing to normal users.\n\n## Solution (Error Handling)\n\n1. \"Avoid using e.printStackTrace() in production code as it can expose sensitive information about the system. Instead, use a logging framework like Log4J or SLF4J to log errors.\"\n\n2. \"Ensure that error messages displayed to the user are generic and do not reveal any details about the system's internal workings. This helps to prevent information leakage.\"\n\n3. \"Implement a centralized error handling mechanism to ensure consistent handling of errors across the application. This can also help to prevent duplicate code and make the code easier to maintain.\"\n\n4. \"Use try-catch blocks to handle exceptions and ensure that the application can recover gracefully from errors. This can also help to prevent the application from crashing unexpectedly.\"\n\n5. \"Consider using a security framework like OWASP ESAPI to help protect against common security vulnerabilities. This can provide additional layers of protection for your application.\"\n\n6. \"Regularly review and monitor your application logs to detect any unusual activity or potential security threats. This can help you to identify and respond to security incidents more quickly.\"\n\n7. \"Ensure that all exceptions are handled appropriately and that the application does not continue to execute with an inconsistent state after an exception has occurred. This can help to prevent further errors and potential security vulnerabilities.\"\n\n8. \"Consider using automated tools to scan your code for common security vulnerabilities. This can help to identify potential issues before they become a problem.\"\n## In Context Remediation\n```\nVulnerable code: e.printStackTrace()\n```\nHere is an example of how to handle errors securely in Java. In this example, we will use the Apache Log4j library for logging errors. \n\nFirst, add the following dependency to your Maven `pom.xml` file:\n\n```xml\n<dependency>\n    <groupId>org.apache.logging.log4j</groupId>\n    <artifactId>log4j-core</artifactId>\n    <version>2.14.1</version>\n</dependency>\n```\n\nThen, here is the modified `stealTheCheese` method:\n\n```java\nimport org.apache.logging.log4j.LogManager;\nimport org.apache.logging.log4j.Logger;\nimport org.owasp.webgoat.lessons.AttackResult;\n\npublic class SSRFTask1 {\n    private static final Logger logger = LogManager.getLogger(SSRFTask1.class);\n\n    public AttackResult stealTheCheese(String url) {\n        try {\n            // Code to steal the cheese goes here\n        } catch (Exception e) {\n            logger.error(\"An error occurred while stealing the cheese\", e);\n            return new AttackResult(false, \"An unexpected error occurred. Please try again later.\");\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\n\nIn this code, instead of using `e.printStackTrace()`, we use `logger.error()` to log the error. This method logs the error message and the stack trace to a log file, which can be reviewed by developers or system administrators to understand what went wrong. \n\nThe user is presented with a generic error message \"An unexpected error occurred. Please try again later.\" This message does not reveal any details about the internal workings of the application, which could be useful to an attacker.\n\nThis approach mitigates potential security issues by preventing information leakage. By not revealing internal details to the user, we make it harder for an attacker to understand the internal workings of our application and exploit potential vulnerabilities. At the same time, by logging the error details, we ensure that we have the information we need to understand and fix the problem.\n\n\n## References\n- [OWASP: Improper Error Handling](https://owasp.org/www-community/Improper_Error_Handling)\n- [OWASP: Error Handling Cheat Sheet](https://cheatsheetseries.owasp.org/cheatsheets/Error_Handling_Cheat_Sheet.html)\n- [CWE-209: Generation of Error Message Containing Sensitive Information](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/209.html)\n\n\n"

                "markdown": "## Description\n\nServer-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) is a type of vulnerability that allows an attacker to force a server to make requests on their behalf. This can be used to interact with internal resources, perform actions on behalf of the server, or even to launch attacks against other systems.\n\nIn Java, one way this vulnerability can occur is through the use of the `URLConnection` class. If an attacker can control the URL that is passed to the `openStream()` method, they can potentially force the server to make arbitrary requests.\n\nFile Disclosure via `URLConnection` is another vulnerability that can occur if an attacker can control the URL that is passed to the `openStream()` method. This could allow the attacker to read arbitrary files from the server's file system.\n\n## Mitigation Advice\n\nTo mitigate these vulnerabilities, you should:\n\n- Never trust user input: Always validate and sanitize user input, especially when it is used to construct URLs.\n- Use a safe API: If possible, use a safe API that does not allow the execution of arbitrary URLs.\n- Limit URL connections: Restrict the URLs that your application can connect to, and deny all others.\n- Use a firewall: Use a firewall to block outgoing connections to untrusted services and hosts.\n\n## Source Code Fix Recommendation\n\nInstead of:\n\n```java\nInputStream in = new URL(url).openStream();\n```\n\nYou could use:\n\n```java\nURL serverUrl = new URL(url);\nif (isTrustedUrl(serverUrl)) {\n    InputStream in = serverUrl.openStream();\n}\n```\n\nWhere `isTrustedUrl()` is a method that checks if the URL is in a list of trusted URLs.\n\n## Library Dependencies\n\nThe code example does not require any additional library dependencies. It uses the `java.net.URL` and `java.io.InputStream` classes, which are part of the Java standard library.\n\n## OWASP and CWE Resources\n\n- [OWASP SSRF Bible](https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Server_Side_Request_Forgery)\n- [OWASP Top 10 2017 A5-Broken Access Control](https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Top_10-2017_A5-Broken_Access_Control)\n- [CWE-918: Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF)](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/918.html)\n- [CWE-22: Improper Limitation of a Pathname to a Restricted Directory ('Path Traversal')](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/22.html)"

This method compares two strings irrespective of their cases, but it does not take into account Unicode normalization. This means that two strings that appear identical to users but have different underlying Unicode representations may be considered unequal, potentially leading to security issues.\n\n## Mitigation Advice\n\nTo mitigate this vulnerability, you should use a Unicode normalization form before performing string comparisons. Java provides the `java.text.Normalizer` class for this purpose. You should normalize both strings to the same form before comparing them.\n\n## Source Code Fix Recommendation\n\nHere is a fixed version of the code:\n\n```java\nimport java.text.Normalizer;\n\nString normalizedUsername = Normalizer.normalize(username, Normalizer.Form.NFC);\nString normalizedSessionUsername = Normalizer.normalize(getWebSession().getUserName(), Normalizer.Form.NFC);\n\nif (normalizedUsername.equalsIgnoreCase(normalizedSessionUsername)) {\n    // ...\n}\n```\n\n## Library Dependencies\n\nThe provided code example requires the following library dependencies:\n\n- `java.text.Normalizer`: This is a built-in Java class and does not require any additional library.\n\n## References\n\n- [OWASP - Unicode Transformation Issues](https://cheatsheetseries.owasp.org/cheatsheets/Unicode.html)\n- [CWE-176: Improper Handling of Unicode Encoding](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/176.html)"

It occurs when an application assembles an XML structure from user-controlled data without properly validating or escaping it. This can allow an attacker to control the structure and content of the XML sent to the application, leading to various types of attacks such as unauthorized data access, denial of service, or even remote code execution.\n\nIn the provided code snippet, the `field1` variable is directly concatenated into an XML string without any validation or escaping. If an attacker can control the value of `field1`, they could potentially inject malicious XML content.\n\n## Mitigation Advice\n\nTo mitigate this vulnerability, you should always validate and sanitize user-controlled data before using it to construct XML. This can be done by using a library that provides safe XML construction methods, or by manually escaping special XML characters.\n\n## Source Code Fix Recommendation\n\nHere is a simple fix using the `StringEscapeUtils.escapeXml10()` method from the Apache Commons Text library to escape special XML characters:\n\n```java\nimport org.apache.commons.text.StringEscapeUtils;\n\n// ...\n\nString safeField1 = StringEscapeUtils.escapeXml10(field1);\ncart.append(\"<p>We have charged credit card:\" + safeField1 + \"<br />\");\n```\n\n## Library Dependencies\n\nThe above code fix requires the following library:\n\n- Apache Commons Text\n\n## References\n\n- [OWASP XML External Entity (XXE) Processing](https://owasp.org/www-project-top-ten/2017/A4_2017-XML_External_Entities_(XXE))\n- [CWE-91: XML Injection (aka Blind XPath Injection)](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/91.html)"

It is a type of injection issue that occurs when an application assembles an XML document including user-controlled data. This can lead to a variety of security issues, depending on the specifics of the XML parser being used. For example, an attacker could exploit this vulnerability to inject malicious code or elements into the XML document, potentially leading to unauthorized access to sensitive data, denial of service, or remote code execution.\n\nIn the provided code snippet, the vulnerability arises from the fact that the `totalSale` variable, which is concatenated into the `cart` string, is not properly sanitized or escaped. This means that if `totalSale` contains any special characters or sequences that have special meaning in XML (such as `&`, `<`, `>`, etc.), they could be interpreted by the XML parser in ways that the developer did not intend.\n\n## Mitigation Advice\n\nTo mitigate this type of vulnerability, it is recommended to:\n\n1. Avoid including user-controlled data in XML documents whenever possible.\n2. If user-controlled data must be included in an XML document, ensure that it is properly sanitized or escaped before it is included. This can often be accomplished using library functions specifically designed for this purpose.\n3. Use a safe API which provides a parameterized interface or has built-in XML injection protections.\n\n## Source Code Fix Recommendation\n\nIn the provided code snippet, a possible fix would be to use `String.format()` method to ensure that `totalSale` is properly converted to a string before it is appended to `cart`. This can help to prevent any special characters in `totalSale` from being interpreted as XML markup.\n\n```java\ncart.append(String.format(\"                               $%.2f\", totalSale));\n```\n\n## Library Dependencies\n\nThe provided code snippet does not appear to require any specific library dependencies to execute properly.\n\n## References\n\n- [OWASP XML Injection](https://owasp.org/www-community/vulnerabilities/XML_External_Entity_(XXE)_Processing)\n- [CWE-91: XML Injection (aka Blind XPath Injection)](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/91.html)"

The XMLStreamReader in Java is susceptible to this vulnerability if not properly configured. Attackers can exploit this vulnerability to read local files on the server, interact with internal systems, or perform denial-of-service attacks.\n\n## Mitigation Advice\n\nTo mitigate this vulnerability, you should disable Document Type Definitions (DTDs) in your XML parser configuration. This can be done by setting the `IS_SUPPORTING_EXTERNAL_ENTITIES` and `SUPPORT_DTD` properties to `false`.\n\n## Source Code Fix Recommendation\n\nHere is a code snippet that demonstrates how to properly configure the XMLInputFactory to prevent XXE:\n\n```java\nXMLInputFactory xif = XMLInputFactory.newInstance();\nxif.setProperty(XMLInputFactory.SUPPORT_DTD, false); // This disables DTDs entirely for that factory\nxif.setProperty(XMLInputFactory.IS_SUPPORTING_EXTERNAL_ENTITIES, false); // disable external entities\n\nXMLStreamReader xsr = xif.createXMLStreamReader(new StringReader(xml));\n```\n\n## Library Dependencies\n\nThe code example requires the following library dependencies:\n\n- `javax.xml.stream.XMLInputFactory`\n- `javax.xml.stream.XMLStreamReader`\n\n## References\n\n- [OWASP XXE Prevention Cheat Sheet](https://cheatsheetseries.owasp.org/cheatsheets/XML_External_Entity_Prevention_Cheat_Sheet.html)\n- [CWE-611: Improper Restriction of XML External Entity Reference ('XXE')](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/611.html)"

Input validation should happen as early as possible in the data flow, preferably as soon as the data is received from the external party.\n\nData from all potentially untrusted sources should be subject to input validation, including not only Internet-facing web clients but also backend feeds over extranets, from suppliers, partners, vendors or regulators, each of which may be compromised on their own and start sending malformed data.\n\n\n## Solution (Bean Validation)\n\n```java\npublic class ExampleDto implements Serializable {\n    @Pattern(regexp = \"white list regular expression\")\n    @Size(min = minimum field size, max = maximum field size)\n    private String fieldName;\n}\n```\n\n## Solution (Validation Service or Method)\n\n```java\npublic boolean validateData(string data, String whiteListRegex) {\n    Pattern p = Pattern.compile(whiteListRegex);\n    Matcher m = p.matcher(data);\n    return m.matches();\n}\n```\n\n\n## In Context Remediation\n```\nField name: org.owasp.webgoat.lessons.xss.Comment.user\nValidation regex: user=\"^[a-zA-Z0-9._-]{3,}$\"\nMinimum length: 1\nMaximum length: 100\n```\n```\nField name: org.owasp.webgoat.lessons.xss.Comment.dateTime\nValidation regex: dateTime=\"^([0-2][0-9]|(3)[0-1])(\\/)(((0)[0-9])|((1)[0-2]))(\\/)\\d{4}$\"\nMinimum length: 1\nMaximum length: 30\n```\n```\nField name: org.owasp.webgoat.lessons.xss.Comment.text\nValidation regex: text=\"^[a-zA-Z0-9\\s.,!?]*$\"\nMinimum length: 1\nMaximum length: 500\n```\n#### Option I\n\nHere is a simple example of how you can validate the \"text\" parameter using Java Bean Validation and regex pattern. \n\n```java\nimport javax.validation.constraints.Pattern;\nimport javax.validation.constraints.Size;\nimport org.hibernate.validator.constraints.Length;\n\npublic class Comment {\n\n    @Pattern(regexp = \"^[a-zA-Z0-9\\\\s.,!?]*$\", message = \"Invalid characters in text\")\n    @Length(min = 1, max = 500, message = \"Text length must be between 1 and 500 characters\")\n    private String text;\n\n    // getters and setters\n    public String getText() {\n        return text;\n    }\n\n    public void setText(String text) {\n        this.text = text;\n    }\n}\n```\n\nTo validate the Comment object, you can use the Validator interface provided by the Java Bean Validation API.\n\n```java\nimport javax.validation.Validation;\nimport javax.validation.Validator;\nimport javax.validation.ValidatorFactory;\n\npublic class CommentValidator {\n\n    public static void main(String[] args) {\n        Comment comment = new Comment();\n        comment.setText(\"Your text here\");\n\n        ValidatorFactory factory = Validation.buildDefaultValidatorFactory();\n        Validator validator = factory.getValidator();\n\n        Set<ConstraintViolation<Comment>> violations = validator.validate(comment);\n        for (ConstraintViolation<Comment> violation : violations) {\n            System.out.println(violation.getMessage()); \n        }\n    }\n}\n```\n\nDependencies needed to run this application:\n\n```xml\n<dependencies>\n    <dependency>\n        <groupId>javax.validation</groupId>\n        <artifactId>validation-api</artifactId>\n        <version>2.0.1.Final</version>\n    </dependency>\n    <dependency>\n        <groupId>org.hibernate.validator</groupId>\n        <artifactId>hibernate-validator</artifactId>\n        <version>6.0.13.Final</version>\n    </dependency>\n    <dependency>\n        <groupId>org.glassfish</groupId>\n        <artifactId>javax.el</artifactId>\n        <version>3.0.0</version>\n    </dependency>\n</dependencies>\n```\n\nThis example uses the Hibernate Validator which is the reference implementation of the Java Bean Validation API. The GlassFish EL dependency is required for expression language support.\n\n#### Option II\n\nHere is a simple Java console application that validates the \"text\" parameter using the provided regex pattern. This application uses the java.util.regex package for regex matching.\n\n```java\nimport java.util.Scanner;\nimport java.util.regex.Pattern;\n\npublic class Main {\n    public static void main(String[] args) {\n        Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);\n        System.out.println(\"Enter text: \");\n        String text = scanner.nextLine();\n        Comment comment = new Comment();\n        try {\n            comment.setText(text);\n            System.out.println(\"Text is valid.\");\n        } catch (IllegalArgumentException e) {\n            System.out.println(e.getMessage());\n        }\n        scanner.close();\n    }\n}\n\nclass Comment {\n    private static final Pattern VALID_TEXT_PATTERN = Pattern.compile(\"^[a-zA-Z0-9\\\\s.,!?]*$\");\n    private static final int MAX_LENGTH = 500;\n    private String text;\n\n    public void setText(String text) {\n        if (text == null || text.length() < 1 || text.length() > MAX_LENGTH) {\n            throw new IllegalArgumentException(\"Text length must be between 1 and 500 characters.\");\n        }\n        if (!VALID_TEXT_PATTERN.matcher(text).matches()) {\n            throw new IllegalArgumentException(\"Text contains invalid characters.\");\n        }\n        this.text = text;\n    }\n}\n```\n\nThis application does not require any external dependencies, it only uses built-in Java packages. To run this application, you need to have a Java Runtime Environment (JRE) installed on your machine.\n\nThe application starts by asking the user to enter a text. This text is then passed to the `setText` method of the `Comment` class. The `setText` method first checks if the text length is between 1 and 500 characters. If the length is not within this range, it throws an `IllegalArgumentException`. Then it checks if the text matches the provided regex pattern. If the text does not match the pattern, it throws another `IllegalArgumentException`. If the text passes both checks, it is considered valid and is set as the `text` field of the `Comment` class.\n\n\n\n## References\n- [OWASP: REST Security Cheat Sheet](https://cheatsheetseries.owasp.org/cheatsheets/REST_Security_Cheat_Sheet.html)\n- [OWASP: Input Validation Cheat Sheet](https://cheatsheetseries.owasp.org/cheatsheets/Input_Validation_Cheat_Sheet.html)\n- [OWASP: Bean Validation Cheat Sheet](https://cheatsheetseries.owasp.org/cheatsheets/Bean_Validation_Cheat_Sheet.html)\n\n\n"

I'll assume you meant a reasonable length, such as 1 to 255 characters.\n\nHere's a simple Java console application demonstrating this:\n\n```java\nimport java.util.regex.Pattern;\nimport java.util.regex.Matcher;\n\npublic class TextValidator {\n\n    private static final String TEXT_PATTERN = \"^[a-zA-Z0-9\\\\s.,!?-]*$\";\n    private static final int MIN_LENGTH = 1;\n    private static final int MAX_LENGTH = 255;\n\n    public static void main(String[] args) {\n        String userInput = \"Hello, World!\"; // Example input, replace with actual user input\n\n        try {\n            validateText(userInput);\n            System.out.println(\"Input is valid.\");\n        } catch (IllegalArgumentException e) {\n            System.out.println(\"Validation error: \" + e.getMessage());\n        }\n    }\n\n    public static void validateText(String text) {\n        if (text == null) {\n            throw new IllegalArgumentException(\"Text cannot be null.\");\n        }\n\n        if (text.length() < MIN_LENGTH || text.length() > MAX_LENGTH) {\n            throw new IllegalArgumentException(\"Text length must be between \" + MIN_LENGTH + \" and \" + MAX_LENGTH + \" characters.\");\n        }\n\n        Pattern pattern = Pattern.compile(TEXT_PATTERN);\n        Matcher matcher = pattern.matcher(text);\n\n        if (!matcher.matches()) {\n            throw new IllegalArgumentException(\"Text contains invalid characters.\");\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n- **Imports**: We import `java.util.regex.Pattern` and `java.util.regex.Matcher` for regex operations.\n- **Validation Method**: `validateText` checks if the input is null, if its length is within the specified range, and if it matches the regex pattern.\n- **Main Method**: Demonstrates how to use the validation method with a sample input.\n\n### Dependencies:\nThis example uses only standard Java libraries, so no additional dependencies are required beyond the JDK.\n\n### Running the Application:\n1. Save the code in a file named `TextValidator.java`.\n2. Compile the code using `javac TextValidator.java`.\n3. Run the compiled class with `java TextValidator`.\n\nThis example provides a basic framework for validating user input securely in a Java application. Adjust the `MIN_LENGTH` and `MAX_LENGTH` constants as needed for your specific use case.\n\n\n\n## References\n- [OWASP: REST Security Cheat Sheet](https://cheatsheetseries.owasp.org/cheatsheets/REST_Security_Cheat_Sheet.html)\n- [OWASP: Input Validation Cheat Sheet](https://cheatsheetseries.owasp.org/cheatsheets/Input_Validation_Cheat_Sheet.html)\n- [OWASP: Bean Validation Cheat Sheet](https://cheatsheetseries.owasp.org/cheatsheets/Bean_Validation_Cheat_Sheet.html)\n\n\n"

By manipulating variables that reference files with “dot-dot-slash (../)” sequences and its variations or by using absolute file paths, it may be possible to access arbitrary files and directories stored on file system including application source code or configuration and critical system files.\n\nTo mitigate this vulnerability in Java, you can use path canonicalization and ensure that the resolved path is within a designated base directory. \n\n## Solution (Path Canonicalization)\n\n```java\n\n    // Base directory where files are allowed to be accessed\n    private static final String BASE_DIRECTORY = \"/safe/base/directory\";\n\n        /**\n         * Resolves the user input to a secure file path within the base directory.\n         *\n         * @param userInput The user-provided file path.\n         * @return A File object if the path is valid and within the base directory, otherwise null.\n         * @throws IOException If an error occurs during path resolution.\n         */\n        public static File getSecureFile(String userInput) throws IOException {\n            // Create a file object from the user input\n            File file = new File(BASE_DIRECTORY, userInput);\n\n            // Canonicalize the file path\n            String canonicalPath = file.getCanonicalPath();\n\n            // Check if the canonical path starts with the base directory path\n            if (canonicalPath.startsWith(new File(BASE_DIRECTORY).getCanonicalPath())) {\n                return file;\n            } else {\n                // The path is outside the base directory, deny access\n                return null;\n            }\n        }\n\n```\n\n\n## In Context Remediation\n```\nPath construction: new File(destinationDir, username + \"_changed\")\nPath canonicalization: new File(destinationDir, username + \"_changed\").getCanonicalPath()\n```\nHere is a simple Java console application that demonstrates how to securely canonicalize a file path. This application uses Apache Commons IO library to handle file operations.\n\n```java\nimport org.apache.commons.io.FileUtils;\nimport org.apache.commons.io.FilenameUtils;\n\nimport java.io.File;\nimport java.io.IOException;\n\npublic class FilePathCanonicalization {\n\n    public static void main(String[] args) {\n        String destinationDir = \"/home/user/documents\";\n        String username = \"../etc/passwd\"; // This is an example of a malicious input\n\n        File file = new File(destinationDir, username + \"_changed\");\n\n        try {\n            String canonicalPath = file.getCanonicalPath();\n            String basePath = new File(destinationDir).getCanonicalPath();\n\n            if (!FilenameUtils.directoryContains(basePath, canonicalPath)) {\n                throw new IllegalArgumentException(\"File path is not within the intended directory\");\n            }\n\n            System.out.println(\"File path is within the intended directory\");\n\n        } catch (IOException e) {\n            e.printStackTrace();\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\n\nThis application first creates a `File` object with the provided `destinationDir` and `username`. It then gets the canonical path of the file and the base directory. The `FilenameUtils.directoryContains()` method is used to check if the file resides within the intended directory. If it does not, an `IllegalArgumentException` is thrown.\n\nTo run this application, you need the following dependencies:\n\n1. Java Development Kit (JDK) - to compile and run the Java application.\n2. Apache Commons IO - to use the `FilenameUtils` class for file operations.\n\nYou can add Apache Commons IO to your project using Maven by adding the following to your `pom.xml` file:\n\n```xml\n<dependencies>\n    <dependency>\n        <groupId>commons-io</groupId>\n        <artifactId>commons-io</artifactId>\n        <version>2.8.0</version>\n    </dependency>\n</dependencies>\n```\n\nOr, if you're using Gradle, add this to your `build.gradle` file:\n\n```groovy\ndependencies {\n    implementation 'commons-io:commons-io:2.8.0'\n}\n```\n\nPlease replace the `destinationDir` and `username` variables with your actual values.\n\n\n\n## References\n- [OWASP: Path Traversal](https://owasp.org/www-community/attacks/Path_Traversal)\n- [OWASP: Input Validation Cheat Sheet](https://cheatsheetseries.owasp.org/cheatsheets/Input_Validation_Cheat_Sheet.html)\n- [CWE-22: Improper Limitation of a Pathname to a Restricted Directory ('Path Traversal')](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/22.html)\n\n\n"

By manipulating variables that reference files with “dot-dot-slash (../)” sequences and its variations or by using absolute file paths, it may be possible to access arbitrary files and directories stored on file system including application source code or configuration and critical system files.\n\nTo mitigate this vulnerability in Java, you can use path canonicalization and ensure that the resolved path is within a designated base directory. \n\n## Solution (Path Canonicalization)\n\n```java\n\n    // Base directory where files are allowed to be accessed\n    private static final String BASE_DIRECTORY = \"/safe/base/directory\";\n\n        /**\n         * Resolves the user input to a secure file path within the base directory.\n         *\n         * @param userInput The user-provided file path.\n         * @return A File object if the path is valid and within the base directory, otherwise null.\n         * @throws IOException If an error occurs during path resolution.\n         */\n        public static File getSecureFile(String userInput) throws IOException {\n            // Create a file object from the user input\n            File file = new File(BASE_DIRECTORY, userInput);\n\n            // Canonicalize the file path\n            String canonicalPath = file.getCanonicalPath();\n\n            // Check if the canonical path starts with the base directory path\n            if (canonicalPath.startsWith(new File(BASE_DIRECTORY).getCanonicalPath())) {\n                return file;\n            } else {\n                // The path is outside the base directory, deny access\n                return null;\n            }\n        }\n\n```\n\n\n## In Context Remediation\n```\nPath construction: new File(fileLocation, username)\nPath canonicalization: Invalid input.\n```\nnull\n\n\n\n## References\n- [OWASP: Path Traversal](https://owasp.org/www-community/attacks/Path_Traversal)\n- [OWASP: Input Validation Cheat Sheet](https://cheatsheetseries.owasp.org/cheatsheets/Input_Validation_Cheat_Sheet.html)\n- [CWE-22: Improper Limitation of a Pathname to a Restricted Directory ('Path Traversal')](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/22.html)\n\n\n"

                "markdown": "## Description\n\nSpring CSRF (Cross-Site Request Forgery) protection disabled vulnerability refers to a security flaw in a Spring-based Java application where the CSRF protection is turned off. CSRF is an attack that tricks the victim into submitting a malicious request. It uses the identity and privileges of the victim to perform an undesired function on their behalf. If the CSRF protection is disabled in a Spring application, it can lead to potential CSRF attacks.\n\n## General Mitigation Advice\n\n1. **Enable CSRF Protection**: Always enable CSRF protection in your Spring application. Spring Security provides built-in CSRF protection that can be enabled in your application.\n\n2. **Use Anti-CSRF Tokens**: Use anti-CSRF tokens in your application. These tokens are included in requests and validated by the server. They provide a way to ensure that the requester knowingly and willingly made the request.\n\n3. **Update and Patch**: Always keep your Spring framework and all other dependencies up-to-date. Newer versions often come with security patches that fix known vulnerabilities.\n\n## Source Code Fix Recommendation\n\nIn Spring, CSRF protection is enabled by default. If it has been disabled, it can be re-enabled by removing the `.csrf().disable()` line from your Spring Security configuration.\n\nHere is an example of a Spring Security configuration with CSRF protection enabled:\n\n```java\n@Configuration\n@EnableWebSecurity\npublic class WebSecurityConfig extends WebSecurityConfigurerAdapter {\n    @Override\n    protected void configure(HttpSecurity http) throws Exception {\n        http\n            .csrf().and() // This line enables CSRF protection\n            .authorizeRequests()\n                .antMatchers(\"/resources/**\", \"/signup\", \"/about\").permitAll()\n                .anyRequest().authenticated()\n                .and()\n            .formLogin()\n                .loginPage(\"/login\")\n                .permitAll()\n                .and()\n            .logout()\n                .permitAll();\n    }\n}\n```\n\n## OWASP Resources\n\n- [Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) Prevention Cheat Sheet](https://cheatsheetseries.owasp.org/cheatsheets/Cross-Site_Request_Forgery_Prevention_Cheat_Sheet.html)\n- [CSRF Prevention in Java](https://cheatsheetseries.owasp.org/cheatsheets/Cross-Site_Request_Forgery_Prevention_Cheat_Sheet.html#java)\n\n## Common Weakness Enumeration (CWE)\n\n- [CWE-352: Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/352.html)"

The GlassFish's EL implementation is used to evaluate the expressions in the constraints.\n\n#### Option II\n\nHere is a simple Java console application that validates the \"text\" parameter of the \"Comment\" class using a regex pattern. The application uses the built-in java.util.regex package for regex matching.\n\n```java\nimport java.util.regex.Matcher;\nimport java.util.regex.Pattern;\n\npublic class Main {\n    public static void main(String[] args) {\n        Comment comment = new Comment();\n        comment.setText(\"Hello, World!\");\n\n        if (validateText(comment.getText())) {\n            System.out.println(\"Valid text\");\n        } else {\n            System.out.println(\"Invalid text\");\n        }\n    }\n\n    public static boolean validateText(String text) {\n        if (text.length() < 1 || text.length() > 1000) {\n            return false;\n        }\n\n        Pattern pattern = Pattern.compile(\"^[a-zA-Z0-9\\\\s.,!?]*$\");\n        Matcher matcher = pattern.matcher(text);\n        return matcher.matches();\n    }\n}\n\nclass Comment {\n    private String text;\n\n    public String getText() {\n        return text;\n    }\n\n    public void setText(String text) {\n        this.text = text;\n    }\n}\n```\n\nThis application does not require any additional dependencies to run, as it only uses built-in Java packages. To run this application, you need to have a Java Development Kit (JDK) installed on your machine. You can compile the application using the `javac` command and run it using the `java` command.\n\nPlease note that this is a very basic example and does not include any error handling or user input. In a real-world application, you would likely want to include additional checks and handle potential exceptions.\n\n\n\n## References\n- [OWASP: REST Security Cheat Sheet](https://cheatsheetseries.owasp.org/cheatsheets/REST_Security_Cheat_Sheet.html)\n- [OWASP: Input Validation Cheat Sheet](https://cheatsheetseries.owasp.org/cheatsheets/Input_Validation_Cheat_Sheet.html)\n- [OWASP: Bean Validation Cheat Sheet](https://cheatsheetseries.owasp.org/cheatsheets/Bean_Validation_Cheat_Sheet.html)\n\n\n"

This application uses Apache Commons IO library to handle file operations.\n\n```java\nimport java.io.File;\nimport java.io.IOException;\nimport org.apache.commons.io.FileUtils;\n\npublic class SecureFileHandler {\n    private static final String INTENDED_DIRECTORY = \"/path/to/intended/directory\";\n\n    public static void main(String[] args) {\n        String fileLocation = args[0]; // Get the file location from command line argument\n        createDirectory(fileLocation);\n    }\n\n    public static void createDirectory(String fileLocation) {\n        try {\n            File file = new File(fileLocation).getCanonicalFile();\n\n            if (!file.getPath().startsWith(INTENDED_DIRECTORY)) {\n                throw new SecurityException(\"Invalid file path\");\n            }\n\n            if (!file.exists()) {\n                FileUtils.forceMkdir(file);\n                System.out.println(\"Directory created successfully\");\n            } else {\n                System.out.println(\"Directory already exists\");\n            }\n        } catch (IOException e) {\n            e.printStackTrace();\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\n\nThis application takes a file location as a command line argument and attempts to create a directory at that location. Before creating the directory, it checks if the canonicalized file path starts with the intended directory path. If not, it throws a `SecurityException`.\n\nTo run this application, you need the following dependencies:\n\n1. Java Development Kit (JDK) - to compile and run the Java application.\n2. Apache Commons IO - to handle file operations. You can add it to your project using Maven or Gradle.\n\nFor Maven, add the following to your `pom.xml`:\n\n```xml\n<dependencies>\n    <dependency>\n        <groupId>commons-io</groupId>\n        <artifactId>commons-io</artifactId>\n        <version>2.8.0</version>\n    </dependency>\n</dependencies>\n```\n\nFor Gradle, add the following to your `build.gradle`:\n\n```gradle\ndependencies {\n    implementation 'commons-io:commons-io:2.8.0'\n}\n```\n\nTo compile and run the application, use the following commands:\n\n```bash\njavac SecureFileHandler.java\njava SecureFileHandler /path/to/directory\n```\n\nReplace `/path/to/directory` with the actual path where you want to create the directory.\n\n\n\n## References\n- [OWASP: Path Traversal](https://owasp.org/www-community/attacks/Path_Traversal)\n- [OWASP: Input Validation Cheat Sheet](https://cheatsheetseries.owasp.org/cheatsheets/Input_Validation_Cheat_Sheet.html)\n- [CWE-22: Improper Limitation of a Pathname to a Restricted Directory ('Path Traversal')](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/22.html)\n\n\n"

This example uses the Apache Commons IO library to handle the file path canonicalization.\n\n```java\nimport org.springframework.web.bind.annotation.RequestParam;\nimport org.springframework.web.multipart.MultipartFile;\nimport org.springframework.security.core.Authentication;\nimport org.springframework.web.servlet.ModelAndView;\nimport org.apache.commons.io.FilenameUtils;\nimport java.io.File;\nimport java.io.IOException;\n\npublic class FileServer {\n\n    private static final String INTENDED_DIRECTORY = \"/path/to/intended/directory\";\n\n    public ModelAndView importFile(@RequestParam(\"file\") MultipartFile multipartFile, Authentication authentication) throws IOException {\n        String originalFilename = multipartFile.getOriginalFilename();\n        String canonicalFilename = new File(INTENDED_DIRECTORY, originalFilename).getCanonicalPath();\n\n        if (!canonicalFilename.startsWith(INTENDED_DIRECTORY)) {\n            throw new SecurityException(\"File is outside of the intended directory!\");\n        }\n\n        // Continue with file processing...\n        return new ModelAndView();\n    }\n}\n```\n\nThis code first gets the original filename from the multipart file. It then creates a new `File` object with the intended directory and the original filename. The `getCanonicalPath` method is used to get the canonicalized file path. If the canonicalized file path does not start with the intended directory, a `SecurityException` is thrown.\n\nTo run this application, you will need the following dependencies:\n\n- Spring Web (for `@RequestParam`, `MultipartFile`, `ModelAndView`)\n- Spring Security (for `Authentication`)\n- Apache Commons IO (for `FilenameUtils`)\n\nYou can add these dependencies to your Maven `pom.xml` file:\n\n```xml\n<dependencies>\n    <dependency>\n        <groupId>org.springframework</groupId>\n        <artifactId>spring-web</artifactId>\n        <version>5.3.10</version>\n    </dependency>\n    <dependency>\n        <groupId>org.springframework.security</groupId>\n        <artifactId>spring-security-core</artifactId>\n        <version>5.5.1</version>\n    </dependency>\n    <dependency>\n        <groupId>commons-io</groupId>\n        <artifactId>commons-io</artifactId>\n        <version>2.11.0</version>\n    </dependency>\n</dependencies>\n```\n\nPlease replace the version numbers with the versions that are compatible with your project.\n\n\n\n## References\n- [OWASP: Path Traversal](https://owasp.org/www-community/attacks/Path_Traversal)\n- [OWASP: Input Validation Cheat Sheet](https://cheatsheetseries.owasp.org/cheatsheets/Input_Validation_Cheat_Sheet.html)\n- [CWE-22: Improper Limitation of a Pathname to a Restricted Directory ('Path Traversal')](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/22.html)\n\n\n"

The `@Email` annotation ensures that the parameter is a well-formed email address. The `@Size` annotation ensures that the length of the parameter value is between 1 and 100 characters. The `@Pattern` annotation ensures that the parameter value matches the specified regex pattern.\n\nDependencies needed to run this application:\n\n```xml\n<dependencies>\n    <dependency>\n        <groupId>javax.validation</groupId>\n        <artifactId>validation-api</artifactId>\n        <version>2.0.1.Final</version>\n    </dependency>\n    <dependency>\n        <groupId>org.hibernate</groupId>\n        <artifactId>hibernate-validator</artifactId>\n        <version>6.0.13.Final</version>\n    </dependency>\n    <dependency>\n        <groupId>org.glassfish</groupId>\n        <artifactId>javax.el</artifactId>\n        <version>3.0.0</version>\n    </dependency>\n</dependencies>\n```\n\nThese dependencies include the Java Bean Validation API, the Hibernate Validator (which is an implementation of this API), and the Expression Language API used by the Hibernate Validator.\n\n#### Option II\n\nHere is a simple Java console application that validates the \"recipient\" parameter using the provided regex pattern. This application uses the Java's built-in `Pattern` and `Matcher` classes for regex matching.\n\n```java\nimport java.util.Scanner;\nimport java.util.regex.Matcher;\nimport java.util.regex.Pattern;\n\npublic class Main {\n    public static void main(String[] args) {\n        Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);\n        System.out.println(\"Enter recipient email:\");\n        String recipient = scanner.nextLine();\n\n        if (validateRecipient(recipient)) {\n            System.out.println(\"Recipient is valid.\");\n        } else {\n            System.out.println(\"Recipient is invalid.\");\n        }\n    }\n\n    public static boolean validateRecipient(String recipient) {\n        if (recipient.length() < 1 || recipient.length() > 100) {\n            return false;\n        }\n\n        String regex = \"^[a-zA-Z0-9._%+-]+@[a-zA-Z0-9.-]+\\\\.[a-zA-Z]{2,6}$\";\n        Pattern pattern = Pattern.compile(regex);\n        Matcher matcher = pattern.matcher(recipient);\n\n        return matcher.matches();\n    }\n}\n```\n\nThis application reads the recipient email from the console input and validates it using the `validateRecipient` method. The method first checks if the length of the recipient string is between 1 and 100. Then it compiles the provided regex pattern and matches it against the recipient string.\n\nDependencies:\n- Java Development Kit (JDK) 8 or later.\n\nTo run this application, you need to have JDK installed on your machine. You can compile the application using the `javac` command and run it using the `java` command.\n\n\n\n## References\n- [OWASP: REST Security Cheat Sheet](https://cheatsheetseries.owasp.org/cheatsheets/REST_Security_Cheat_Sheet.html)\n- [OWASP: Input Validation Cheat Sheet](https://cheatsheetseries.owasp.org/cheatsheets/Input_Validation_Cheat_Sheet.html)\n- [OWASP: Bean Validation Cheat Sheet](https://cheatsheetseries.owasp.org/cheatsheets/Bean_Validation_Cheat_Sheet.html)\n\n\n"
